If there is a large amount of data in an Autonomous Database, it can take some time to clone the database (for example up to an hour for a 7TB database). When cloning happens, when precisely does billing for the clone start? Is it when the user clicks the Clone button, or when the provisioning is completed? Similarly, when an Autonomous Database is terminated, does billing stop as soon as the user presses the Terminate button, or when termination is complete?

The exact location of the data varies from sheet to sheet:  the only constant is that the first column is a date and the second column has \"Monthly return\" as the header.  In this example, the data starts in cell B5:  How do I automate the search of Excel cells for my \"Monthly return\" string using R? At the moment, the best idea I can come up with is to upload everything in R starting at cell A1 and sort out the mess in the resulting (huge) matrices.  I'm hoping for a more elegant solution I haven't found a way to do this elegantly, but I'm very familiar with this problem (getting data from FactSet PA reports -> Excel -> R, right?).  I understand different reports have different formats, and this can be a pain. For a slightly different version of annoyingly formatted spreadsheets, I do the following.  It's not the most elegant (it requires two reads of the file) but it works.  I like reading the file twice, to make sure the columns are of the correct type, and with good headers.  It's easy to mess up column imports, so I'd rather have my code read the file twice than go through and clean up columns myself, and the read_excel defaults, if you start at the right row, are pretty good. Also, it's worth noting that as of today (2017-04-20), readxl had an update.  I installed the new version to see if that would make this very easy, but I don't believe that's the case, although I could be mistaken. Okay, at the format was specified for xls, update from csv to the correctly suggested xls loading. You would get something similar to: then you can dynamincally filter on the \"Monthly return\" cell and identify your matrix.  With a general purpose package like readxl, you'll have to read twice, if you want to enjoy automatic type conversion. I assume you have some sort of upper bound on the number of junk rows at the front? Here I assumed that was 10. I'm iterating over worksheets in one workbook, but the code would look pretty similar if iterating over workbooks. I'd write one function to handle a single worksheet or workbook then use lapply() or purrr::map(). This function will encapsulate the skip-learning read and the \"real\" read. In those cases it's important to know the possible conditions of your data. I'm gonna assume that you want only remove columns and rows that doesn't confrom your table. I have this Excel book: I added 3 blank columns at left becouse when I loaded in R with one column the program omits them. Thats for confirm that R omits empty cols at the left. First: load data Second: I added some cols with NA and '' values in the case that your data contain some Third: Remove columns when all values are NA and ''. I have to deal with that kind of problems in past Fourth: Keep only rows with complete observations (it's what I supose from your example) Finally if you want to keep the header you can make something like this: or Here is how I would tackle it. STEP 1     Read the excel spreadsheet in without the headers. STEP 2      Find the row index for your string Monthly return in this case STEP 3     Filter from the identified row (or column or both), prettify a little and done. Here is what a sample function looks like. It works for your example no matter where it is in the spreadsheet. You can play around with regex to make it more robust. Function Definition: Example: No matter ho many rows or columns you may have, the idea remains the same.. Give it a try and let me know. This is a tidy alternative that avoids the multiple reads issue discussed above. However, when doing benchmarks, Rafael Zayas's answer still wins out. This gives you first column with year.

If your goal is just to change the color of the logo, and you don't necessarily NEED to use CSS, then don't use javascript or jquery as was suggested by some previous answers. To precisely answer the original question, just: Open your logo.svg in a text editor. look for fill: #fff and replace it with fill: #000 For example, your logo.svg might look like this when opened in a text editor: ... just change the fill and save. You could set your SVG as a mask. That way setting a background-color would act as your fill color. HTML CSS JSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/KuhlTime/2j8exgcb/ MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask Please check whether your browser supports this feature: https://caniuse.com/#search=mask Try pure CSS: more info in this article https://blog.union.io/code/2017/08/10/img-svg-fill/ If you want a dynamic color, do not want to use javascript and do not want an inline SVG, use a CSS variable. Works in Chrome, Firefox and Safari. edit: and Edge In your SVG, replace any instances of style=\"fill: #000\" with style=\"fill: var(--color_fill)\". You will first have to inject the SVG into the HTML DOM. There is an open source library called SVGInject that does this for you. It uses the onload attribute to trigger the injection. Here is a minimal example using SVGInject: After the image is loaded the onload=\"SVGInject(this) will trigger the injection and the <img> element will be replaced by the contents of the SVG file provided in the src attribute. It solves several issues with SVG injection: SVGs can be hidden until injection has finished. This is important if a style is already applied during load time, which would otherwise cause a brief \"unstyled content flash\". The <img> elements inject themselves automatically. If you add SVGs dynamically, you don't have to worry about calling the injection function again. A random string is added to each ID in the SVG to avoid having the same ID multiple times in the document if an SVG is injected more than once. SVGInject is plain Javascript and works with all browsers that support SVG. Disclaimer: I am the co-author of SVGInject This answer is based on answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/24933495/3890888 but with a plain JavaScript version of the script used there. You need to make the SVG to be an inline SVG. You can make use of this script, by adding a class svg to the image: And then, now if you do: Or may be: JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/erxu0dzz/1/ Edit your SVG file, add fill=\"currentColor\" to svg tag and make sure to remove any other fill property from the file. For example: Note that currentColor is a keyword (not a fixed color in use). After that, you can change the color using CSS, by setting the color property of the element or from it's parent. Example: I forgot to say, you must insert the SVG this way: Note that #img is the id of the svg tag inside svg file. Another way of doing it: https://css-tricks.com/cascading-svg-fill-color/ Why not create a webfont with your svg image or images, import the webfont in the css and then just change the color of the glyph using the css color attribute? No javascript needed The answer from @Praveen is solid. I couldn't get it to respond in my work, so I made a jquery hover function for it. CSS JS / JQuery Use filters to transform to any color. I recently found this solution, and hope somebody might be able to use it. Since the solution uses filters, it can be used with any type of image. Not just svg. If you have a single-color image that you just want to change the color of, you can do this with the help of some filters. It works on multicolor images as well of course, but you can't target a specific color. Only the whole image. The filters came from the script proposed in How to transform black into any given color using only CSS filters If you want to change white to any color, you can adjust the invert value in each filter.  Simple.. You can use this code: First specify the path of svg and then write it's ID, In this case \"Capa_1\". You can get the ID of svg by opening it in any editor. In css: I suggest to select your color , and go to this pen https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp it will convert HEX to css filter eg:#64D7D6 equal the final snippet  If you are just switching the image between the real color and the black-and-white, you can set one selector as: {filter:none;} and another as: To expand on @gringo answer, the Javascript method described in other answers works, but requires the user to download unnecessary image files, and IMO, it bloats your code. I think a better approach would be to to migrate all 1-color vector graphics to a webfont file. I've used Fort Awesome in the past, and it works great to combine your custom icons/images in SVG format, along with any 3rd party icons you may be using (Font Awesome, Bootstrap icons, etc.) into a single webfont file the user has to download. You can also customize it, so you only include the 3rd party icons you're using. This reduces the number of requests the page has to make, and you're overall page weight, especially if you're already including any 3rd party icons libraries. If you prefer a more dev oriented option, you could Google \"npm svg webfont\", and use one of the node modules that's most appropriate for your environment. Once, you've done either of those two options, then you could easily change the color via CSS, and most likely, you've sped up your site in the process. Since SVG is basically code, you need just contents. I used PHP to obtain content, but you can use whatever you want. Then, I've printed content \"as is\" inside a div container To finnaly set rule to container's SVG childs on CSS I got this results with a material icon SVG: Mozilla Firefox 59.0.2 (64-bit) Linux  Google Chrome66.0.3359.181 (Build oficial) (64 bits) Linux  Opera 53.0.2907.37 Linux  The main problem in your case is that you are importing the svg from an <img> tag which will hide the SVG structure. You need to use the <svg> tag in conjunction with the <use> to get the desired effect. To make it work, you need to give an id to the path you want to use in the SVG file <path id='myName'...> to then be able to retrieve them from the <use xlink:href=\"#myName\"/> tag. Try the snipped below.  Note that you can put any URL before the fragment # if you want to load the SVG from an external source (and not embed it into your HTML). Also, usually you do not specify the fill into the CSS. It's better to consider using fill:\"currentColor\" within the SVG itself. The corresponding element's CSS color value will then be used in place. This might be helpful for people using PHP in combination with .svg images that they want to manipulate with CSS. You can't overwrite properties inside a img tag with CSS. But when the svg source code is embedded in the HTML you surely can. I like to resolve this issue with a require_once function where I include a .svg.php file. It's like importing an image but you can still overwrite styles with CSS! First include the svg file: And it includes this icon for example: Now we can easily change the fill color like this with CSS: I first tried to solve this problem with file_get_contents() but the solution above is much faster. open the svg icon in your code editor and add a class after the path tag: You can add class to svg and change the color like this: codepen Know this is an old question but recently we came across the same issue, and we solved it from the server side. This is a php specific answer but I am positive that other envs have something similar. instead of using the img tag you render the svg as svg from the get-go. now when you render the file you will get complete inline svg For me, my svgs looked different when having them as img and svg. So my solution converts the img to csv, changes styles internally and back to img (although it requires a bit more work), I believe \"blob\" also has better compatibility than the upvoted answer using \"mask\". for that matters you have to use your SVG as an inline HTML. say here's your logo.svg code (when you open it on textEditor): Logo.SVG add your desired Class/ID to it (i've added 'logo-img'): Edited Svg Now apply Your Css Rules: CSS Pro Con Heres a Stack Snippet  Directly to svg fill css will not work you can use as below This worked for me Why not just using CSS's filter property to manipulate the color on :hover or whatever other state? I found it works over SVG images into img tags. At least, it's almost fully supported in 2020. It seams to me the simpliest solution. The only caveat is having to tweak the filter properties in order to find the target color. But you have also this very useful tool. If your shape(s) are always one solid color and you have more than a couple, you can use Fontello and make a custom icon font with a whole series of your own custom SVG shapes. Then you can set/animate the size and color of all of them with CSS alone. For all the possible use cases for this question, this is an essential paradigm to consider. I've used it in many projects. In any case, if you haven't heard of Fontello, you need to find out about it. If you know of a similar solution that is better, I would love to know. Possible downfalls: Icon/shape fonts are known to mess with screen readers, so that may take some handling. Fontello can be finicky with importing shapes, and it may take some trial and error with authoring and exporting them. Avoid any and all grouping, and use only single non-nested compound shapes. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "69": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69553827/mysql-connection-closed-when-using-docker", "mysql connection closed when using docker I am facing a problem when I am trying to connect to mysql using docker.

I am facing an issue where my pods are getting terminated and not fulfilling the inflight requests. So to fix this I have added a pod lifecycle perStop hook to wait for 250 seconds to complete all pending requests and set the terminationGracePeriodSeconds to 300 seconds. Now what I was expecting is the moment the pod transitioned to Terminating state, it should stop receiving the new requests and only fulfill the requests that it already has, but this did not happen. Pod continued to receive the traffic until the last second and eventually got killed once the perStop completed and eventually the calling application received 502 error code. So to debug this I moved further and doubted it could be the endpoints that are not getting updated properly in the service but I was wrong. The moment the pod transitioned to the Terminating state the endpoint is removed from the service, but the pod continued getting the traffic. Then I log in to the node and check the IPtables to get the IP table forwarding rules to verify if the pod IP is still there, but the IPtable forwarding rules got updated immediately when the pod transition to Terminating. So the tables got updated immediately by the kube-proxy but still, the pod is receiving the traffic. I tried port forwarding the service directly as well as hitting it with the network flow (ELB->Ingress->Service->pod) thinking it might be the Loadbalancer issue but the results are the same.

How should I go about making a user submit work? The main issue in your code is that you need to stop the form from submitting the data. To do that add an argument to your event handler which accepts the event that's raised, and call preventDefault() on it to stop the submission. Also note that as you're loading jQuery in order to implement the FeedEk library, you may as well keep the code consistent and use it to attach your event handlers and work with the DOM. Then you need to retrieve the value property from the #rssUrl input field, not pass the entire Element object in the request. To do that in jQuery use the val() method.

Each record has a dynamic amount of fields set, so I don't want to have any makeUpdatedSchema step (e.g., this code) at all. This both keeps code more simple and I would assume improves performance since I don't have to recreate schemas for each record. I tried doing something like the applySchemaless code as shown here even when the record has a schema by returning something like this, with null for schema: However, in runtime it errors out, saying I have an incompatible schema. I might be misunderstanding the role of the schema at this point in the process (is it needed at all once we're in the Elasticsearch sink connector?) or how it works, and if so that would be helpful to know as well.

One, Project Valid Users, has as members every user that's assigned a permission in the Project. That group has a few permissions granted by default: Create/Edit/Delete Shared Analytics Views. It does not, however, have the View project-level information permission granted, meaning users in that group can't (by default) access the Project at all, rendering the Analytics permissions pointless.

See https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#caveats The solution is to memoize the value you pass to the provider, or use something like Redux or Zustand. you can use shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) for this method. Use shouldComponentUpdate() to let React know if a component\u2019s output is not affected by the current change in state or props. The default behavior is to re-render on every state change, and in the vast majority of cases you should rely on the default behavior read docs here. As a suggestion try not to use this unless absolutely necessary, this can cause bugs or performance issues but its the only method I know that is there so hpefully it helps Here is a working codesandbox that I created to handle your issue.

Dynamically executing code in exec can be dangerous especially if you are using user input. So make sure you know what you are doing.

If I create a global variable in one function, how can I use that global variable in another function? Do I need to store the global variable in a local variable of the function which needs its access? You can use a global variable within other functions by declaring it as global within each function that assigns a value to it: Since global variables have a long history of introducing bugs (in every programming language), Python wants to make sure that you understand the risks by forcing you to explicitly use the global keyword. See other answers if you want to share a global variable across modules. If I'm understanding your situation correctly, what you're seeing is the result of how Python handles local (function) and global (module) namespaces. Say you've got a module like this: You might expecting this to print 42, but instead it prints 5.  As has already been mentioned, if you add a 'global' declaration to func1(), then func2() will print 42. What's going on here is that Python assumes that any name that is assigned to, anywhere within a function, is local to that function unless explicitly told otherwise.  If it is only reading from a name, and the name doesn't exist locally, it will try to look up the name in any containing scopes (e.g. the module's global scope). When you assign 42 to the name myGlobal, therefore, Python creates a local variable that shadows the global variable of the same name.  That local goes out of scope and is garbage-collected when func1() returns; meanwhile, func2() can never see anything other than the (unmodified) global name.  Note that this namespace decision happens at compile time, not at runtime -- if you were to read the value of myGlobal inside func1() before you assign to it, you'd get an UnboundLocalError, because Python has already decided that it must be a local variable but it has not had any value associated with it yet.  But by using the 'global' statement, you tell Python that it should look elsewhere for the name instead of assigning to it locally. (I believe that this behavior originated largely through an optimization of local namespaces -- without this behavior,  Python's VM would need to perform at least three name lookups each time a new name is assigned to inside a function (to ensure that the name didn't already exist at module/builtin level), which would significantly slow down a very common operation.) You may want to explore the notion of namespaces. In Python, the module is the natural place for global data: Each module has its own private symbol table, which is used as the global symbol table by all functions defined in the module. Thus, the author of a module can use global variables in the module without worrying about accidental clashes with a user\u2019s global variables. On the other hand, if you know what you are doing you can touch a module\u2019s global variables with the same notation used to refer to its functions, modname.itemname. A specific use of global-in-a-module is described here - How do I share global variables across modules?, and for completeness the contents are shared here: The canonical way to share information across modules within a single program is to create a special configuration module (often called config or cfg). Just import the configuration module in all modules of your application; the module then becomes available as a global name. Because there is only one instance of each module, any changes made to the module object get reflected everywhere. For example: File: config.py File: mod.py File: main.py Python uses a simple heuristic to decide which scope it should load a variable from, between local and global.  If a variable name appears on the left hand side of an assignment, but is not declared global, it is assumed to be local.  If it does not appear on the left hand side of an assignment, it is assumed to be global. See how baz, which appears on the left side of an assignment in foo(), is the only LOAD_FAST variable. If you want to refer to a global variable in a function, you can use the global keyword to declare which variables are global. You don't have to use it in all cases (as someone here incorrectly claims) - if the name referenced in an expression cannot be found in local scope or scopes in the functions in which this function is defined, it is looked up among global variables. However, if you assign to a new variable not declared as global in the function, it is implicitly declared as local, and it can overshadow any existing global variable with the same name. Also, global variables are useful, contrary to some OOP zealots who claim otherwise - especially for smaller scripts, where OOP is overkill. We can create a global with the following function: Writing a function does not actually run its code. So we call the create_global_variable function: You can just use it, so long as you don't expect to change which object it points to: For example, and now we can use the global variable: To point the global variable at a different object, you are required to use the global keyword again: Note that after writing this function, the code actually changing it has still not run: So after calling the function: we can see that the global variable has been changed. The global_variable name now points to 'Bar': Note that \"global\" in Python is not truly global - it's only global to the module level. So it is only available to functions written in the modules in which it is global. Functions remember the module in which they are written, so when they are exported into other modules, they still look in the module in which they were created to find global variables. If you create a local variable with the same name, it will overshadow a global variable: But using that misnamed local variable does not change the global variable: Note that you should avoid using the local variables with the same names as globals unless you know precisely what you are doing and have a very good reason to do so. I have not yet encountered such a reason. A follow on comment asks: what to do if I want to create a global variable inside a function inside a class and want to use that variable inside another function inside another class? Here I demonstrate we get the same behavior in methods as we do in regular functions: And now: But I would suggest instead of using global variables you use class attributes, to avoid cluttering the module namespace. Also note we don't use self arguments here - these could be class methods (handy if mutating the class attribute from the usual cls argument) or static methods (no self or cls). In addition to already existing answers and to make this more confusing: In Python, variables that are only referenced inside a function are   implicitly global. If a variable is assigned a new value anywhere   within the function\u2019s body, it\u2019s assumed to be a local. If a variable   is ever assigned a new value inside the function, the variable is   implicitly local, and you need to explicitly declare it as \u2018global\u2019. Though a bit surprising at first, a moment\u2019s consideration explains   this. On one hand, requiring global for assigned variables provides a   bar against unintended side-effects. On the other hand, if global was   required for all global references, you\u2019d be using global all the   time. You\u2019d have to declare as global every reference to a built-in   function or to a component of an imported module. This clutter would   defeat the usefulness of the global declaration for identifying   side-effects. Source: What are the rules for local and global variables in Python?. With parallel execution, global variables can cause unexpected results if you don't understand what is happening. Here is an example of using a global variable within multiprocessing. We can clearly see that each process works with its own copy of the variable: Output: As it turns out the answer is always simple. Here is a small sample module with a simple way to show it in a main definition: Here is how to show it in a main definition: This simple code works just like that, and it will execute. I hope it helps. What you are saying is to use the method like this: But the better way is to use the global variable like this: Both give the same output. You need to reference the global variable in every function you want to use. As follows: Try this: You're not actually storing the global in a local variable, just creating a local reference to the same object that your original global reference refers to. Remember that pretty much everything in Python is a name referring to an object, and nothing gets copied in usual operation. If you didn't have to explicitly specify when an identifier was to refer to a predefined global, then you'd presumably have to explicitly specify when an identifier is a new local variable instead (for example, with something like the 'var' command seen in JavaScript). Since local variables are more common than global variables in any serious and non-trivial system, Python's system makes more sense in most cases. You could have a language which attempted to guess, using a global variable if it existed or creating a local variable if it didn't. However, that would be very error-prone. For example, importing another module could inadvertently introduce a global variable by that name, changing the behaviour of your program. In case you have a local variable with the same name, you might want to use the globals() function. Following on and as an add on, use a file to contain all global variables all declared locally and then import as: File initval.py: File getstocks.py: Writing to explicit elements of a global array does not apparently need the global declaration, though writing to it \"wholesale\" does have that requirement: I'm adding this as I haven't seen it in any of the other answers and it might be useful for someone struggling with something similar. The globals() function returns a mutable global symbol dictionary where you can \"magically\" make data available for the rest of your code.  For example: and Will just let you dump/load variables out of and into the global namespace. Super convenient, no muss, no fuss. Pretty sure it's Python 3 only. Reference the class namespace where you want the change to show up. In this example, runner is using max from the file config. I want my test to change the value of max when runner is using it. main/config.py main/runner.py tests/runner_test.py Globals in connection with multiprocessing on different platforms/envrionments  as Windows/Mac OS on the one side and Linux on the other are troublesome. I will show you this with a simple example pointing out a problem which I run into some time ago. If you want to understand, why things are different on Windows/MacOs and Linux you  need to know that, the default mechanism to start a new process on ... They are different in Memory allocation an initialisation ... (but I don't go into this here). Let's have a look at the problem/example ... If you run this on Windows (And I suppose on MacOS too), you get the following output ... If you run this on Linux, you get the following instead. There are 2 ways to declare a variable as global: 1. assign variable inside functions and use global line 2. assign variable outside functions: Now we can use these declared global variables in the other functions: Note 1: If you want to change a global variable inside another function like update_variables() you should use global line in that function before assigning the variable: Note 2: There is a exception for note 1 for list and dictionary variables while not using global line inside a function: Though this has been answered, I am giving solution again as I prefer single line This is if you wish to create global variable within function site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "218": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69553531/pass-function-argument-dict-inside-a-tuple", "Pass function argument (dict inside a tuple) I am writing a function to generate an API url which accept multiple arguments and replicates a part of the string.

So I have a programming project that I have to do for my school. What I have to do is setup a 2 player dice game. I could have gone the easy way and just display the number of the 2 die, but I was thinking of using images that I made in photoshop instead. However, the problem is that I do not know how to change images in an efficient way. My first option is using the visibility tag on several images laid on top of eachother and change it accordingly as such However, I do not think that is very efficient. Images also do not support changing the image with code from my research. Secondly, I could use a PictureBox instead, which do support changing the image as the program is running. However, it does not support transparency, and the die images are transparent. Plus it gives me the invalid image file error, I guess due to the transparency in the gif files. There is also the cheap workaround of me making the background of the images the same as the form background. So is there a more efficient way I am missing out? I know that the cheap workaround would be the best option for this case, but I would like to have this knowledge for future use like semi-transparent pixels that blend in and such. And before you ask, no, I cannot use another programming language as visual basic 6 is what my school teaches. Thankfully they are changing it soon, but I am stuck with this for now. Nevermind, I am extremely dumb. Turns out you CAN change the pictures of Images, while keeping transparency and stretch. I am going to properly show it This is what I get for believing what I've seen on  some forum.

My thread function which calls the run operation on the io_context looks like this: The number of threads is 1..N. The documentation states that any subsequent calls to run() must call restart() first but restart() must not be called when there are still any active calls to run() which I can't know because there may be still threads calling run(). What is the solution for this when there is just one io_context and many threads calling run() You're right that you need to catch/handle exceptions. The solution to your conundrum is quite simple: run() should actually not be called in a loop. This realization helps because it let's you realize that once run(); exited normally, you can always do a break;. More generically speaking, you could also inspect the return value of run/poll{*} member functions: if it returns zero then the service ran out of work. See also Should the exception thrown by boost::asio::io_service::run() be caught?

A better way, according to the author of the video, would be to use reduce from functools and define compose() function to chain the different data transformations. To illustrate with an example, imagine that I'm writing a program to scrape some text from the web, and I need to clean it for analyzing it later. The \"wrong\" way to do it would be to implement it along the following lines: Output: >>> MyAssignedClass.description: I'm full of things to clean & to skip. If I follow the guidelines proposed in the video, I should create a compose() function instead to chain the transformations. The problem here is that I must use lambda functions everywhere to make it work: output: >>> MyComposedClass.description: I'm full of things to clean & to skip. However, wouldn't it be more readable to just use intermediate variables and assign self.description only at the end of the method? output: >>> MyUnderAssignedClass.description: I'm full of things to clean & to skip. Which are the most pythonic way of writing such piece of code? What are the pitfalls associated with using intermediate variables (and reasssigning the attribute many times within a method)? I disagree with the video author. This question is a great one but the suggestion from the video that x = func(x) should not be used is false in my opinion. For example in numpy it is completely fine to do these transformation with x = func(x) style. In the video example the Compose allows simplification of forward method and in a case where the network would be more complex (hundreds of layers) the original approach would be unpractical. Let's see an example This question is partly about functional versus object oriented approach to coding both of which are fine in python.

Shubham and Tushar are 2 thieves and they had decided to rob a FALTU society. FALTU society consists of N houses in a row. Each of the ith houses has A[i] number of gold coins. To rob the whole society they both came up with a plan that they will make total N trips to the society one by one (starting from Shubham) and perform the below operation in each trip : First the thief (which is going to society) had to choose a house which is not selected in any of the previous trips and this house must be adjacent to the house chosen in the other thief\u2019s last operation. Now assign this house to the current thief. If there are multiple such houses any of them can be chosen. OR If there is no such house that satisfies the above condition or this is Shuhbam's first trip then the thief can choose any house that is not selected before. Now the chosen house will be assigned to the current thief. After these N trips, each thief can have the gold coins present in their assigned houses. They both love gold coins, and each of them is smart enough to perform the optimal moves in order to have the maximum number of gold coins at the end of the robbery. Find the number of gold coins that each thief will have at the end of the robbery. NOTE: Thief performs 2nd type of operation if he is unable to perform the operation of 1st type.

The & has more the one meanings: 1) take the address of a variable 2) pass an argument by reference to a function 3) declare a reference variable 4) bitwise and operator n) others??? To start, note that is a special pointer ( == memory address) to the class its in. First, an object is instantiated: Next, a pointer is instantiated: Next, the memory address of a is assigned to the pointer b: Next, the method CDummy::isitme(CDummy &param) is called: A test is evaluated inside this method: Here's the tricky part. param is an object of type CDummy, but &param is the memory address of param. So the memory address of param is tested against another memory address called \"this\". If you copy the memory address of the object this method is called from into the argument of this method, this will result in true. This kind of evaluation is usually done when overloading the copy constructor Also note the usage of *this, where this is being dereferenced. That is, instead of returning the memory address, return the object located at that memory address. Well the CDummy& param that is declared as a parameter of the function CDummy::isitme is actually a reference which is \"like\" a pointer, but different. The important thing to note about references is that inside functions where they are passed as parameters, you really have a reference to the instance of the type, not \"just\" a pointer to it. So, on the line with the comment, the '&' is functioning just like in C, it is getting the address of the argument passed in, and comparing it to this which is, of course, a pointer to the instance of the class the method is being called on. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "318": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69553348/wierd-looking-grouped-barplots", "Wierd looking grouped barplots I have an issue with my grouped barplots, I want to visualize gene expression, and since some genes had very high expression I decided to se the ylim to different values to better visualize the lower values.

I assume your toast is a something like <React.createContext().Provider />. In this case it is not possible to call toast.attribute, at least according to my understanding. You would have to use a Higher order component for classes, and in your case, the useContext hook or something similar for functional components.

So not sure if those background jobs and the scheduled jobs are suitable to be running inside our ASP.NET Core MVC web application hosted inside IIS? Now when we were developing \"Classic\" ASP.NET MVC (before the ASP.NET Core MVC), we were always told that such web projects are not designed for running long running tasks and/or scheduled tasks, where console applications are best for these types of tasks. For example IIS will go to sleep mode so background jobs might not get fired at the desired time if no one is using the web application + if we run long running tasks inside IIS they might get timed-out before the tasks complete.

The Server Code: The Client Code: This exception means that there is no service listening on the IP/port you are trying to connect to: I would check: The simplest starting point is probably to try to connect manually from the client machine using telnet or Putty. If that succeeds, then the problem is in your client code. If it doesn't, you need to work out why it hasn't. Wireshark may help you on this front. You have to connect your client socket to the remote ServerSocket. Instead of Socket clientSocket = new Socket(\"localhost\", 5000); do Socket clientSocket = new Socket(serverName, 5000); The client must connect to serverName which should match the name or IP of the box on which your ServerSocket was instantiated (the name must be reachable from the client machine). BTW: It's not the name that is important, it's all about IP addresses... I had the same problem, but running the Server before running the Client fixed it. One point that I would like to add to the answers above is my experience- \"I hosted on my server on localhost and was trying to connect to it through an android emulator by specifying proper URL like http://localhost/my_api/login.php . And I was getting connection refused error\" Point to note - When I just went to browser on the PC and use the same URL (http://localhost/my_api/login.php) I was getting correct response so the Problem in my case was the term localhost which I replaced with the IP for my server (as your server is hosted on your machine) which made it reachable from my emulator on the same PC. To get IP for your local machine, you can use ipconfig command on cmd  you will get IPv4 something like 192.68.xx.yy Voila ..that's your machine's IP where you have your server hosted. use it then instead of localhost http://192.168.72.66/my_api/login.php Note - you won't be able to reach this private IP from any node outside this computer. (In case you need ,you can use Ngnix for that) I had the same problem with Mqtt broker called vernemq.but solved it by adding the following. to show the list o allowed ips and ports for vernemq to add any ip and your new port. now u should be able to connect without any problem. Hope it solves your problem. Hope my experience may be useful to someone. I faced the problem with the same exception stack trace and I couldn't understand what the issue was. The Database server which I was trying to connect was running and the port was open and was accepting connections. The issue was with internet connection. The internet connection that I was using was not allowed to connect to the corresponding server. When I changed the connection details, the issue got resolved. In my case, I gave the socket the name of the server (in my case \"raspberrypi\"), and instead an IPv4 address made it, or to specify, IPv6 was broken (the name resolved to an IPv6) In my case, I had to put a check mark near Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS in docker setting (on the right side of the task bar, right click on docker, select setting) i got this error because I closed ServerSocket inside a for loop that try to accept number of clients inside it (I did not finished accepting all clints) so be careful where to close your Socket I had same problem and the problem was that I was not closing socket object.After using socket.close(); problem solved. This code works for me. ClientDemo.java and  ServerDemo.java I changed my DNS network and it fixed the problem You probably didn't initialize the server or client is trying to connect to wrong ip/port. Change local host to your ip address There is a service called MySQL80  that should be running to connect to the database for windows you can access it by searching for services  than look for MySQL80 service and make sure it is running It could be that there is a previous instance of the client still running and listening on port 5000. I had the same issue, and it turned out to be due to permission of the catalina.out file not being correct.  It was not writable by the tomcat user.  Once I fixed the permissions, the issue got resolved.

As per description in intel n2sw_nii5v2gen2 NIOS II software developer handbook, intel Nios II process reference guide n2cpu-nii5v1gen2 and intel ug_embedded_ip, shadow register should automatically switch to set3 when executing irq2 ISR and switch back to set0 after ISR is done at eret. Preemption between IRQ with same register set should not happen, especially under BSP configuration of enable_preemption_rs_3=false. But unfortunately the misusing stack issue happens. After many expriments, we found it is related to the branch in funnel code in altera_vic_funnel_non_preemptive.S as below: In normal case, which is also the most often case, instruction 0x552dc is skipped. But in case when issue reproduced, break point on 0x552dc is always hit before the reproduction.

In SQL, I would use: I tried to look at Pandas' documentation, but I did not immediately find the answer. To select rows whose column value equals a scalar, some_value, use ==: To select rows whose column value is in an iterable, some_values, use isin: Combine multiple conditions with &: Note the parentheses. Due to Python's operator precedence rules, & binds more tightly than <= and >=. Thus, the parentheses in the last example are necessary. Without the parentheses is parsed as which results in a Truth value of a Series is ambiguous error. To select rows whose column value does not equal some_value, use !=: isin returns a boolean Series, so to select rows whose value is not in some_values, negate the boolean Series using ~: For example, yields If you have multiple values you want to include, put them in a list (or more generally, any iterable) and use isin: yields Note, however, that if you wish to do this many times, it is more efficient to make an index first, and then use df.loc: yields or, to include multiple values from the index use df.index.isin: yields There are several ways to select rows from a Pandas dataframe: Below I show you examples of each, with advice when to use certain techniques. Assume our criterion is column 'A' == 'foo' (Note on performance: For each base type, we can keep things simple by using the Pandas API or we can venture outside the API, usually into NumPy, and speed things up.) Setup The first thing we'll need is to identify a condition that will act as our criterion for selecting rows. We'll start with the OP's case column_name == some_value, and include some other common use cases. Borrowing from @unutbu: ... Boolean indexing requires finding the true value of each row's 'A' column being equal to 'foo', then using those truth values to identify which rows to keep.  Typically, we'd name this series, an array of truth values, mask.  We'll do so here as well. We can then use this mask to slice or index the data frame This is one of the simplest ways to accomplish this task and if performance or intuitiveness isn't an issue, this should be your chosen method.  However, if performance is a concern, then you might want to consider an alternative way of creating the mask. Positional indexing (df.iloc[...]) has its use cases, but this isn't one of them.  In order to identify where to slice, we first need to perform the same boolean analysis we did above.  This leaves us performing one extra step to accomplish the same task. Label indexing can be very handy, but in this case, we are again doing more work for no benefit pd.DataFrame.query is a very elegant/intuitive way to perform this task, but is often slower. However, if you pay attention to the timings below, for large data, the query is very efficient. More so than the standard approach and of similar magnitude as my best suggestion. My preference is to use the Boolean mask Actual improvements can be made by modifying how we create our Boolean mask. mask alternative 1 Use the underlying NumPy array and forgo the overhead of creating another pd.Series I'll show more complete time tests at the end, but just take a look at the performance gains we get using the sample data frame.  First, we look at the difference in creating the mask Evaluating the mask with the NumPy array is ~ 30 times faster.  This is partly due to NumPy evaluation often being faster. It is also partly due to the lack of overhead necessary to build an index and a corresponding pd.Series object. Next, we'll look at the timing for slicing with one mask versus the other. The performance gains aren't as pronounced.  We'll see if this holds up over more robust testing. mask alternative 2 We could have reconstructed the data frame as well.  There is a big caveat when reconstructing a dataframe\u2014you must take care of the dtypes when doing so! Instead of df[mask] we will do this If the data frame is of mixed type, which our example is, then when we get df.values the resulting array is of dtype object and consequently, all columns of the new data frame will be of dtype object.  Thus requiring the astype(df.dtypes) and killing any potential performance gains. However, if the data frame is not of mixed type, this is a very useful way to do it. Given Versus We cut the time in half. mask alternative 3 @unutbu also shows us how to use pd.Series.isin to account for each element of df['A'] being in a set of values.  This evaluates to the same thing if our set of values is a set of one value, namely 'foo'.  But it also generalizes to include larger sets of values if needed.  Turns out, this is still pretty fast even though it is a more general solution.  The only real loss is in intuitiveness for those not familiar with the concept. However, as before, we can utilize NumPy to improve performance while sacrificing virtually nothing. We'll use np.in1d Timing I'll include other concepts mentioned in other posts as well for reference. Code Below Each column in this table represents a different length data frame over which we test each function. Each column shows relative time taken, with the fastest function given a base index of 1.0. You'll notice that the fastest times seem to be shared between mask_with_values and mask_with_in1d.  Functions Testing Special Timing Looking at the special case when we have a single non-object dtype for the entire data frame. Code Below Turns out, reconstruction isn't worth it past a few hundred rows.  Functions Testing The Pandas equivalent to is Multiple conditions: or In the above code it is the line df[df.foo == 222] that gives the rows based on the column value, 222 in this case. Multiple conditions are also possible: But at that point I would recommend using the query function, since it's less verbose and yields the same result: I find the syntax of the previous answers to be redundant and difficult to remember. Pandas introduced the query() method in v0.13 and I much prefer it. For your question, you could do df.query('col == val') Reproduced from http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.0/indexing.html#indexing-query You can also access variables in the environment by prepending an @. August 2019 updated answer Since pandas >= 0.25.0 we can use the query method to filter dataframes with pandas methods and even column names which have spaces. Normally the spaces in column names would give an error, but now we can solve that using a backtick (`) - see GitHub: Using .query with method str.endswith: Output Also we can use local variables by prefixing it with an @ in our query: Output Faster results can be achieved using numpy.where. For example, with unubtu's setup - Timing comparisons: Here is a simple example For selecting only specific columns out of multiple columns for a given value in Pandas: Options loc: or query: To append to this famous question (though a bit too late): You can also do df.groupby('column_name').get_group('column_desired_value').reset_index() to make a new data frame with specified column having a particular value. E.g. Run this gives: In newer versions of Pandas, inspired by the documentation (Viewing data): Combine multiple conditions by putting the clause in parentheses, (), and combining them with & and | (and/or). Like this: Other filters You can also use .apply: It actually works row-wise (i.e., applies the function to each row).

But before doing so I would appreciate a couple of pointers/suggestions. the goal is to make a full page load instead of just loading the content/body part of the page. I have about 20 years of experience with LAMP/LEMP and Javascript and servers (hosted my own servers for 15 years) and I love to work in CLI.

While there is a concept of \"default branch name\" in git, I do not see any mention of \"default branch\" in git documentation or Pro Git book. However, I do see mentions of \"default branch\" in git hosting platforms such as GitHub and GitLab. So, is there a concept of \"default branch\" in vanilla git? Or is it only a concept used by git hosting platforms? In git's model, there are no special \"server\" or \"central\" repositories. When you clone a repository, then git will by default check out whatever branch is checked out on that other repository. More specifically, it will copy the .git/HEAD file from the other repository into the new clone. At the most basic, a git server (including hosting platforms such as Github and GitLab) is just what git calls a \"bare repository\", which contains all the files which would normally be in the .git directory, but no working copy. See the manual for git clone --bare and \"Git on the Server\" in the Pro Git book. That means the repository still has a file called HEAD which contains a reference to the \"current\" branch. When you perform a clone from the server, that is the reference copied to your new .git/HEAD. As such, it acts as the \"default branch\" for new clones, but in git's terminology it is actually the \"current\" branch. Management UIs commonly also use this as a convenient way to set the default branch shown in the file browser, the default target for pull/merge requests, etc. The closest thing seems to be the init.defaultBranch config entry. It allows to set which name will be used at git init for the first commit/branch. (see also here) The default value for this parameter is master. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "401": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69553186/sum-same-dates-on-one-column-each", "Sum same dates on one column each thank you in advance for your help.

How to solve this problem? Optional chaining (?.) lets us write code where TypeScript can immediately stop running some expressions if we run into a null or undefined. So in your case you have used object?.balance which means if object is not null try to access the balance property. So if object is in withoutBalance type it raises an error like this: Property 'balance' does not exist on type WithoutBalance. You can use in operator in your component like this: You should consider using Type Narrowing in the angular template. Check out this answer In such cases either introduce a new property named type in the objects with the name of the type as a string and add a condition or either check for the property inside the object in the template like the above answer. Solution 1 Solution 2 You can simply do this: It is important to use == null instead of withoutBalance.balance??0 because balance is of type number and if you do actually have a balance and its value happens to be 0 or 1 typescript will convert it into a boolean so using == null will ensure that it will only be true if balance is null or undefined. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "403": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69553183/dagger-hilt-inject-interface-that-inherits-another-interface", "Dagger Hilt: Inject interface that inherits another interface I have an app that implements MVP pattern and I want to simplify boilerplate code with Hilt.

A number (from 2 to 36) that represents the numeral system to be used To convert from a number to a hex string: Example radix values: Example Usage Integer value to hex:  Hex string to integer value:  Integer value to decimal:  I came to this post needing to convert from base 10 to 62 and vice-versa. Whilst the solutions here are great, parseInt and toString only support base 2 to 36. So if anyone finds themselves in a similar position to me needing base 2 to 62, I've pasted my solution below. https://gist.github.com/ryansmith94/91d7fd30710264affeb9  You may try the following code, which also supports arbitrary precision numbers (larger than 2^53). Usage: The basic code has been found here, I have a bit improved it to also support up to base 64. The following diagram might help. Note that to convert from base 16 to base 2 you need to convert first to base 10 and then base 2.  Well, I made a function that could translate from base 10 to any base. (This depends on how many strings you have in the array A, if it's more than that + 10 it'll run out of symbols), and I almost cried when I found out you could to it in less than 10 characters with that... Add a bookmark and as URL insert this... I've done it the long but personal way. At least, mine can use a base which is higher than 36. You can add more symbols yourself, but if you want, I can make it for you...  Specify the radix you want to use as a parameter. NOTE: This only works to convert from bases 2-36 to decimal and little values. About \"little\", parseInt(\"6f\", 32) is fine (= 207), but any other little bigger will be also 207, 6f1, 6f11, ... This function generate decimal number to any base from 2 to 36.(as like javascript)But you can  Increase the base more than 36 just by adding new character in keys[] like lowercase[\"a\",\"b\"]  Usually I use this function to convert from different bases. For example, it returns \"11111111\" for both cases: convertBase(\"ff\", 16, 2) or convertBase(0xFF, 16, 2) I've written a function to convert a JavaScript string from one base to another base, with the original base and the new base specified as parameters.  Using the parseInt function: Try the following code, optimised from Slavik Meltser's post, implements BASE n conversions with all the radix combinations between Base2 and Base256.  This code accepts three sorts of arguments to define source and destination number systems: You'll see that some number system numerals have been hard-coded inside the class and will be used as default when you pass the radix as an argument. (.e.g. 64) When no hard-coded numeral exists (e.g. 16), default numerals are assigned for all radixes ranging between Base2 and Base256, which becomes very clear in the self-test further below. Usage:  Self-Test:  Check the complete JS code to convert into different base You can also convert number in hexadecimal to decimal as follows: where you can change a with any hexadecimal number and get the result in decimal form. You can use JavaScript's built-in integer literals for some scenarios:  to convert numbers into different bases in JavaScript or typescript using the following ways.  here in the binary function, you can use number.toString(2) function, but the problem occurs when representing negative numbers. so that you can use the unsigned right shift bitwise operator (>>>) to fix this issue. This function converts a number from base 10, to an arbitrary base: which can be useful if you want to use weird bases along with weird char-set As mentioned by the users above  let n = 13; console.log(n.toString(2)); will result in 13 conversion from base 10 to base 2. But in case if you want to program the same. I have written a recursive method to do the same. which just simply divide by 2 and then count remainders.  site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "410": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69553171/drawing-a-partial-circle-with-path", "Drawing a partial circle with path I'm trying to draw a partial circle with svg's path.

[duplicate] REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural pattern/style. A service based on REST is called a RESTful service. What is Rest API ? and Is there any difference between Rest API, Rest Web service and Restfull web service ? A RESTful web service is the implementation of the REST API (Application Programmable Interface) or the REST spec. In this case you are also creating an API with your endpoints that you create. In a sense they are actually the same thing and are just two terms that are interchangeable in the context of your question. The wording may be a little confusing but tl;dr; RESTful Web Service == REST API == REST Web Service for this situation Outside of the context of the OP's question an API is not the same as a Web Service. An API can mean any interface or library used to interact with anything from code. This can be a smart dishwasher API or Web Sockets or cell phone SMS or even jQuery. In that same sense a Web Service is just a kind of API that provides information over the web. API means Application Programming Interface. A REST API or RESTful API is an API that is compliant to REST. REST is usually implemented using web technology, but REST does not strictly require web technology to be used. An example of a RESTful API is a RESTful web service or a set of RESTful web services. To summarize: The difference is merely a linguistic one. The difference between REST and RESTful is like the difference between BEAUTY and BEAUTIful. REST is a noun, whereas RESTful is an adjective.

Here is an example of what my service/class would look like: Note that if I am able to access IServiceProvider, I can then retrieve any service I need on the fly using _sProvider.GetService(typeof(MyRequiredService)) so I don't necessarily have to inject other services here. Still, my requirement is to somehow use injection here. For a service registered in Startup.ConfigureServices. The default services.AddSingleton<MyService>() throws an error as the injection is not able to retrieve the first someCustomStuff parameter as a service (and I don't want it to be one!). I actually tried the alternative way to register the service using the constructor explicitely : but I don't know how to access IServiceProvider in Startup.ConfigureServices explicitely... This naturally leads to a more general question about constructor injection for non-component classes and in other places than Startup.ConfigureServices: Is it possible (if so HOW) to get dependency injection with mixed constructors having both injected services and non-injectable parameters? Is it possible (if so HOW) to use dependency injection via constructor in code where I do NOT have explicit access to the services to be injected (if I do, as for e.g. in components, it is trivial as I can easly inject the required services to the component and then forward them to the constructor explicitely...) Yes. I quite often load parameters from appsettings as parameters for services. One easy way is push the values into an \"options\" class and inject that. You can also research the options pattern. For example: When your app starts: This should not happen please explain how you are running code that is not in or being called from a context that does not have access to the Services. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "449": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69553097/wordpress-plugin-to-generate-zip-file-dynamically", "Wordpress plugin to generate .zip file dynamically I have a Wordpress website.

There aren't any 'surprises' in the text such as comments or quoted names, but in my real case the columns don't have a fixed width. The fastest method I've found so far is to use the readr::read_tsv() function. Below are some alternatives that I've tried, but weren't faster than read_tsv(). The data.table::fread() method was surprisingly slow due to it writing the input text to a temporary file first. I haven't managed to figure out a regex-based method to capture the third column, so I don't know if that would be faster.

The @ConfigProperty annotation is in fact a CDI qualifier. In Quarkus, if a field is annotated with a qualifier, it doesn't have to be annotated @Inject -- but it is treated as if it was. So your test class is equivalent to this: Now, the other important thing is that if possible, the Quarkus test framework treats the test class as a CDI bean. That is, the test class is instantiated by the CDI container, which performs dependency injection. That is how testEnv is populated. How do you achieve the same thing?

I'm trying to exclude from a git repository everything except .asd files. The files may be at any level of the directory hierarchy, and any directory at any level may or may not contain dots in their name, making them look like file names in that sense. For example: Set up repository and some directory structure: Add some .asd files at various levels in the tree that we want to include: Majority of the contents of the parent directory hosting the repository is random stuff. The stuff may be files of all sorts of unknown types etc, so specifically declaring everything that should be ignored is not desirable. It is easier (or should be) to declare what we want to include. Add some random stuff: With an empty .gitignore, all is included: I've tried among other the following .gitignore: which only includes file1.asd and file5.asd missing the other 3 .asd files that are within some directories that contain dots in their names. Trying to specifically add one of them reveals the issue: So is it even possible to only see .asd files using only .gitignore in this kind of repository structure? After all the thing pursued here is more of a \".gitinclude\" thing which I guess doesn't exist. Of course I could just forget about trying to define the relevant git scope in .gitignore and instead just use git add *.asd in place of git add . but that is not so nice. E.g. VS Code's git extension stays too colorful then as it considers all the irrelevant files in git's scope too. To defeat Git's .gitignore directory optimization, use: In this case you end up with this .gitignore file: Note that this means that every git status will search every directory in your working tree, regardless of whether that ends up being pointless.

Spoiler: I left a lot of comments in the CSS to tell you what everything does. Alright. There are a lot of things wrong with this. I've decided to rewrite the code because the original was way to messy. It seems that you don't really know a lot about HTML and CSS. I've done half of it for you so you can figure the other half out. Some tips: 1. Make sure to organize, and name everything correctly. If it's an input field, name it \"input-field\" not \"rectangle13\" when your document gets bigger, it's gonna be harder to find out what's going on. 2. When dealing with settings like padding:__ or margin:__, say you wanted the same values for top, left, bottom, and right of the margin or padding, just set it to one singular value. Before: margin: 5px, 5px, 5px, 5px; After: margin: 5px; 3. Don't use <div> for everything. Yes, they're useful, but there are better ways of making input fields and text. Examples: <h1>(heading), <p>(paragraph), <input type=text>(text input) Oh, also: I know that the HTML and CSS I provided isn't perfect (sorry i dont have a lot of time.)

Is there a way to select a derived array from an array in a Redux store without spurious renders? My Redux store contains an array of objects. I wrote a selector to return an array of ids. I then call this selector using react-redux's useSelector hook, inside a component to render out a list of components. I am finding that MyComponent is being rendered every call to dispatch which breaks down performance at a higher number of array elements. I have passed in an equality function to useSelector like so: But dispatch is called enough times that checking equality becomes expensive with a large amount of array elements. I have tried using the reselect library as well. However, every time I modify the properties of one array element in state.items via dispatch, this changes the dependency of selectItems which causes selectIds to recalculate. What I want is for selectIds to only recompute when the ids of state.items are modified. Is this possible? I think the best you can do here is to combine reselect with the use of shallowEqual: Notes With the code above: If this solution is not enough (can't afford the shallowEqual) you can take a look at https://github.com/dai-shi/react-tracked it uses a more precise system to track which part of the state is used (using Proxies: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy). site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "544": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69552926/how-did-directory-opus-and-xplorer2-replace-the-system-explorer-work", "how did Directory Opus and xplorer2 replace the system explorer work?

So you're thinking in a fairly OOP fashion, Go does not have inheritance (to clarify it has struct embedding which is what you are doing in your first example). We tend to favour composition to solve problems. One way you could look at solving your problem is like the below. Names can be improved, but it should act as a basic example of an approach that could be taken. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "547": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69552922/need-help-getting-an-error-with-python-expected-an-indented-block", "Need help, getting an error with Python expected an indented block [duplicate] I am getting: As the error message indicates, you have an indentation error. It is probably caused by a mix of tabs and spaces. There are in fact multiples things you need to know about indentation in Python: In a lot of other languages the indention is not necessary but improves readability. In Python indentation replaces the keyword begin / end or { } and is therefore necessary. This is verified before the execution of the code, therefore even if the code with the indentation error is never reached, it won't work. 1. \"IndentationError: expected an indented block\" They are two main reasons why you could have such an error: - You have a \":\" without an indented block behind. Here are two examples: Example 1, no indented block: Input: Output: The output states that you need to have an indented block on line 4, after the else: statement Example 2, unindented block: Input: Output The output states that you need to have an indented block line 2, after the if 3 != 4: statement - You are using Python2.x and have a mix of tabs and spaces: Input Please note that before if, there is a tab, and before print there is 8 spaces. Output: It's quite hard to understand what is happening here, it seems that there is an indent block... But as I said, I've used tabs and spaces, and you should never do that. 2. \"IndentationError: unexpected indent\" It is important to indent blocks, but only blocks that should be indent. So basically this error says: - You have an indented block without a \":\" before it. Example: Input: Output: The output states that he wasn't expecting an indent block line 2, then you should remove it. 3. \"TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation\" (python3.x only)  Just look at the line number of the error, and fix it using the previous information. I had this same problem and discovered (via this answer to a similar question) that the problem was that I didn't properly indent the docstring properly. Unfortunately IDLE doesn't give useful feedback here, but once I fixed the docstring indentation, the problem went away. Specifically --- bad code that generates indentation errors: Good code that avoids indentation errors: Note: I'm not saying this is the problem, but that it might be, because in my case, it was! in python intended block mean there is every thing must be written in manner in my case I written it this way Note.its give me error,until I written it in this way such that \"giving spaces \" then its giving me a block as I am trying to show you in function below code You might want to check you spaces and tabs. A tab is a default of 4 spaces. However, your \"if\" and \"elif\" match, so I am not quite sure why. Go into Options in the top bar, and click \"Configure IDLE\". Check the Indentation Width on the right in Fonts/Tabs, and make sure your indents have that many spaces. This is just an indentation problem since Python is very strict when it comes to it. If you are using Sublime, you can select all, click on the lower right beside 'Python' and make sure you check 'Indent using spaces' and choose your Tab Width to be consistent, then Convert Indentation to Spaces to convert all tabs to spaces. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "548": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69552921/the-pgadmin-4-server-could-not-be-contacted-in-linux-mint-20-2", "The pgAdmin 4 server could not be contacted in Linux Mint 20.2 Folks i just installed pgAdmin 4 from here.

I'm using an alpha texture to make semi-transparent surfaces, like glass. However when shadows are being cast, the shadow is removed completely instead of using the alpha texture as gradient. Basically I want a similar effect like this BabylonJS example: https://playground.babylonjs.com/#P1RZV0 When casting shadows I'm using the MeshDepthMaterial in order to let the light cast shadows through transparent surfaces, like this: This works fine however as mentioned, shadows should not disappear completely but rather use the alpha texture as indicator how strong the shadow should be. The more opaque a surface is the stronger the shadow should be and vice versa.

I have two tables in my database, Memberships and MembershipTypes. Each Membership can have multiple MembershipTypes, and so I have an association table called 'associationtable_membership_membershiptypes'. At present that association table just contains the membershipID and the membershipTypeID. This works great because, on the Python side, I can set something up like this in the Membership class: I can add to this list in the code and then, when I call the session commit, that association table is populated. It also works on the other side too when I get the records. I should also say that AssociationTable_Membership_MembershipTypes is a class, the 'association object'. I know people can do this relationship with just the table, but I didn't. So, to the problem. Each Membership can have multiple of the SAME MembershipType (same record in the table, same object in memory in Python). At first I thought maybe I could add multiple entries into the association table that were the same (I could get around the uniqueness aspect by having a unique id and then the two IDs for membership and membership type). This did not work, and I am told that this idea to do it this way is just bad pratise as it violates something called 'first normal form'. In what way did it not work? Well SQLAlchemy merely stripped the extra items out of the list. So I needed a different way. The way I think will work is to have a new column in the association table called 'quantity'. That way, if a membership has two Gold membership types (for example), a '2' would appear in the quantity column. The problem for me here is not the idea. I understand the relationship and how that would work. My issue is how to handle it on the Python side. Previously there was just a list which I set up and I could add to, and the commit handled it automatically. I didn't have to step in before that commit to rearrange things. So what is the suggested way of doing this? In addition to my list of Memberships, do I also have to keep a list of AssociationTable_Membership_MembershipTypes? And then, before the commit, query each Membership to see if there are any duplicated ones? And then of course when I fetch the data do the same in reverse? Compared with the ease of doing it before, it seems rather cumbersome and therefore more error prone.

Using State I set my variable to an empty array but when I come to Map it the code is unreachable and I have no idea why. Note: If I map an individual object in the constructor it works perfectly. Here's the code : The problem appears to be when i declare const Subbies = this.state.subbieData after the render because the text appears as though its not active in my code editor. I've tried using let but this makes no difference The Table row is the Data that is appearing as unreachable. I've looked for answers but can't find anything that fits this problem - most of the Unreachable code examples I have come across seem to have some conditional logic causing the issue which this is clearly not I'm new to learning react and this is my first real project so any guidance would be very much appreciated. Many Thanks in advance Matt that's because you have given the array \"Subbies\" and map item \"Subbies\" the same names, just give map item a different name like \"Subby\" or something else. and also the  values should be map item's values like this: You are defining and initializing the SubbieTable constant which is an array of objects. to properly render it try to using simple map function: Note: always use lowercase characters to define your variables and constant, only use uppercase to define a component. Note: you can also create a separated component to render the table data: Now, use the RenderTable component inside of ViewAllSubbies : This is because of the return in the map function and the render not returning anything.

I know there is a recvq and sendq double linked list in chan to record blocked goroutines. My question is how many goroutines totally can be blocked if chan is not read?  Does this depend on memory size? Yes, it depends on the memory. It depends on the len of channel as mentioned in the docs, a buffered channel is blocked once the chan is full, and gets unblocked, when another value is added to the chan. channels Code snippet from docs: Once MaxOutstanding handlers are executing process, any more will block trying to send into the filled channel buffer, until one of the existing handlers finishes and receives from the buffer. TLDR: as long as your app can fit into memory and can run, you won't have any problems with channel waiting queues. The language spec does not limit the number of waiting goroutines for a channel, so there's no practical limit. The runtime implementation might limit the waiting goroutines to an insignificant high value (e.g. due to pointer size, integer counter size or the likes), but to reach such an implementation limit, you would run out of memory much-much sooner. Goroutines are lightweight threads, but they do require a small memory. They start with a small stack which is around a KB, so even if you estimate it to 1 KB, if you have a million goroutines, that's already 1 GB memory at least, and if you have a billion goroutines, that's 1 TB. And a billion is nowhere near to the  max value of an int64 for example. Your CPU and Go runtime would have trouble managing billions of goroutines earlier than running into implementation specific waiting queue limits.

See the code below: There is more to this code however I've only included the relevant snippets for the question. To summarize - why include mappings for bucketname when the bucketname  is set directly, using region and account ID in the 'Resources' section? There is use of the Fn::FindInMap function which is used here as part of the ExecutorLambdaFunction: StateS3Bucket is being built from the region and account ID but that has nothing to do with the Mappings section. The mappings, in this case, are being used to provide the correct region-specific S3 bucket name for where the packaged source code for ExecutorLambdaFunction exists - that is why Fn::FindInMap is being used in the Lambda declaration. Sometimes you may want to have dynamic values based on specific keys - the CloudFormation Mappings section is the perfect solution to this problem. Your packaged Lambda (the source code) is pointing to an S3 location in this case & as S3 buckets are region-specific, you need a way of getting the correct bucket name for the region that the stack is being deployed in. The code for the ExecutorLambdaFunction must be loaded from the S3 bucket in the relevant region otherwise it won't work. For example, trying to load the Lambda source code from a bucket in us-east-1 won't work when your Lambda is deployed in eu-west-2 (note: it will work if it is deployed in us-east-2 as while that is in another availability zone, it is still within the same region). Even if you only intend to have your stack in one region only, it won't harm you to have a Mappings section as it will future proof your CloudFormation template. If you don't have any region-specific infrastructure (quite rare but e.g. only creating IAM roles which are global & are set at an account-level), then you can not include one. You'll spend much more time trying to add one in later than if you just spent an extra 3 minutes defining & using Mappings as you write your template - you'll thank yourself if you later decide to deploy your stack in another region. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "632": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69552767/google-cloud-service-account-calendar", "Google Cloud Service Account & Calendar Does anyone know how to enable the option for \"Make changes & Manage sharing\"?

Any tips on how to speed up my Android app?  Will it make much of an improvement to speed if i moved as many of these public class variables into methods and functions instead of having them as class variables? Thanks in advance. Each Fragment has around 15 public static class variables. Is this bad programming? Probably. If this were traditional Java development, you might be burned at the stake for having that many static fields. In Android, we use them a bit more. 15 for any class is excessive; I would expect a fragment to have zero. Though, to clarify, based on Gabe's comment to your question, I am referring to normal static fields, not constants (e.g., static final int, static final String). Constants are typical, reasonable, and almost assuredly not a performance issue. It seems my app is fairly slow and i'm wondering if it's to do with having so many public static class variables. Probably not. Any tips on how to speed up my Android app? You start by figuring out specifically where you are slow. Whether that is through simple Log statements (to track your progress through your app), through Android Studio method tracing, or something else, is up to you. Points to be considered for optimization 1 - In your app I could see you have 7 fragments. Questions is whether all 7 fragments loaded at the same time or do you have dynamic Fragment Manager to handle all data/view creation as and when needed. If you are loading and creating all fragments at the same time, definitely, this is not the optimal way. Always create view and load data as and when needed. Persist dynamic data which are really historical and necessary for App flow. 2 - Having static class is not bad programing but making unnecessary static class is really bad programing. Identify classes which you considered to be non-static, convert it non-static and optimize further. 3 - You may feel app is slow but there may be non-technical reason behind it. Check which device, platform and configuration you are using to run this app. 4 - Identify data processing which are holding and blocking UI response, create asyncTask/thread to handle such data processing in background. Try to use Lazy loading wherever possible. Create custom adapters with static holders to make flawless UI. 5 - If you feel UI is non-responsive, you can think of multiple patterns to be implemented like recycle Adapter, Chain-of-responsibility, delegation, observers and so on.. 6 - While designing UI, make sure you are using optimal layouts rather than use of multilevel and multi-hierarchical layouts within same xml. you can add this on your application tag in AndroidManifest.

Using: Postgres 10.2 Ignoring some unrelated columns, I have the table transactions with these columns (omitting some unrelated columns): Some important points about the current table: What works well: Insertions and retrieval, since we already know the user - we know which table to look at and hence doesn't have to go through the 100 partitions to find it. What does not: We have a process which deletes the old data quite often - based on users subscription. But this leads to problems (space issues) often as the data deleted doesn't get freed up immediately. As plain VACUUM may not be enough when a table contains large numbers of dead row versions as a result of massive update or delete activity (as is our case here) How we would like to improve this is to be able to store the the data in partitions based on the transaction date - and then be able to drop the tables when the subscription is over. This will make sure that the space is usable again immediately. In short, our main goal is to improve the deletion process so that the space is recovered immediately - at the same time making sure the access performance is not worsened I have a few questions regarding this: Hoping to get some guidance here on the way forward. First: upgrading PostgreSQL would be a very good idea, not only because hash partitioning was introduced after v10, but also because of the numerous improvements in performance and features for partitioning since v10. I have the feeling that the partitioning scheme you are using right now (home-grown hash partitioning) does not help you much. You cannot get rid of a customer with a simple DROP TABLE (which would be nice), and deleting 10 million rows in a partition is not any more fun than deleting them in a single large table. On the contrary \u2013 the relative bloat once autovacuum is done will be more. The only saving grace is that autovacuum will work more efficiently, since it can treat each partition on its own. To answer your questions: Yes, partitioning makes most queries slower; hopefully not much slower. That is the price you are paying. No, your queries will get somewhat slower (proportional to the numbr of partitions, so keep that moderate). You can partition on both criteria, since a partition can again be a partitioned table. But I question if that is really a good idea, since I doubt that your current partitioning scheme is really beneficial. Yes, use at least v12, ideally v14. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "662": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69552709/how-to-scroll-to-top-in-a-react-native-flatlist-while-navigating-from-another-pa", "How to scroll to top in a React Native Flatlist while navigating from another page?

Please do add some description in the answer so that I can understand why this is working the way it is suppose to. Mockito.<ServiceResponse>any() is an instance of ServiceResponse.

On the other hand, Mockito.<Class<ServiceResponse>>any() is an instance of Class<ServiceResponse> Not really, consider following code You can't guarantee the output is always true, as response can be of type CustomServiceResponse(extending ServiceResponse) For your problem, just use ServiceResponse.class, simple and clear.

Specifically your Linux value is the base64 encoding of the characters which are output by the command of the form echo -n \"stuff\" more stuff to most (but not all) Unix shells, while your Windows value is the base64 encoding of the characters followed by space, carriage return, and line feed. Note the added dash-n-and-space and quotemarks (both treated as data; CMD echo does not take options in the form -n nor treat quotes the way a Unix shell does, or even a ported Unix-style program) as well as the trailing space (a difference between the way CMD runs commands on Windows versus the way a shell does on Unix) and CRLF. If you are on Windows 10, you can install the 'Windows Subsystem for Linux' (WSL) with any common Linux distribution, and use that basically the same way you do any real Unix. To do this in CMD you need to cheat like this: There may well be a better way in powershell, which corrects many of the minor flaws and silly things in CMD, but I haven't learned enough about it yet to say. But I don't see why you'd want to; this value is basically useless. What you probably want (or were told) to do is compute the SHA256-HMAC of the date value with a given key. To do that on Unix (or WSL) you need to change your command to but again for CMD you need to cheat. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "677": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69552682/google-sheets-query-unexpected-empty-result-in-the-output", "Google Sheets QUERY: unexpected empty result in the output I'm struggling with a query displaying no result in the output.

What is happening? When an option is omitted from .config (and when it is removed from .config by the build process automatically), this is the same as not having the option set.

I wanted to ask here if this could be considered a legal \"solution\", just modifying the main without changing things inside external functions. Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it will correctly print the length of arbitrary long input lines, and as much as possible of the text. The idea is to set the max lenght of the string considered for the array line ad 2. For a string as abcdef\\n , the array line will be ab. Since the last element of the array is not \\n (thus the line we are considering is not over), we save the length up until now and repeat the cycle. We will get then the array made of cd, then ef and at the end we will get the array of just \\n. Then the else if condition is executed, since the first element of this array is\\n, and we print the tot length obtained from the previous additions. We add +1 in order to also consider the new character \\n. This works also for odd strings: with abcdefg\\n the process will go on up until we reach g\\n and the sum is done correctly.

Each of the four have one square shaped suitcase with them. They want to pack their suitcases into a large square box. The suitcases and the large box are cuboids with a square base and the heights of the large box as well as the four suitcases are exactly the same. Hence the concern is only about the side (length) of the large square box. Your task is to find the minimum length of the large square box so that all the four suitcases can be put into the box without any overlapping.

Please tell me where I am wrong. As it is a homework problem, I won't give you a full solution, but I will let you know why it is failing, which is what you asked, right? Consider the following case: Suppose you only have 2 suitcases for simplicity (you can also consider 2 more of size 1, everything still holds), and moreover the dimensions are 3 and 2 and suppose your box is of size 4. Now your argument claims that the boxes fit, since 4^2 = 16 > 13 = 3^2 + 2^2. However, it is really easy to see that this is not true, as if you put 3x3 suitcase inside of the box, you will only have 1 unit of length from each side, making it impossible to put suitcase of length 2.

I'm confident (maybe?) that if I can properly select the custom meta data and put it in the code I can make the Coupon Bulker plugin to duplicate the plugin with the category assigned. But how do I know what is the proper meta and how to call it? Edit: I'm adding this snapshot to see what I'm trying to achieve here. The columns on the right \"Categor\u00edas\" and \"Etiquetas\" (Categories and tags) are custom. The post seen below is the original and the above is the copy. As you can see, all the information is successfully copied except the data in the custom columns. Coupon type is copied because of the line $new_coupon->set_discount_type($orig_coupon->get_discount_type()); Coupon amount is copied because of the line $new_coupon->set_amount($orig_coupon->get_amount()); And so on. The line to copy the category (and tag at this point) is missing and it's what I'm trying to find.  site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "756": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69552538/hql-hibernate-how-to-get-all-records-where-day-of-enddate-equals-today", "HQL - Hibernate: How to get all records where day of endDate equals today What is the best way to get all records where the endDate has the same day, month and year as today?

Please help. I can't figure it out. If you are fine with using regular expressions in python you could use the following code: Where inside the square brackets you include all the characters (also known as delimiters) that you want to split by, just make sure to keep the quotes around the square brackets as that makes a regex string (what we are using to tell the computer what to split) Further reading on regex can be found here if you feel like it: https://medium.com/factory-mind/regex-tutorial-a-simple-cheatsheet-by-examples-649dc1c3f285 However, if you want to do it without importing anything you could do this, which is another possible solution (and I would recommend against, but it gets the job done well): Which works by first replacing all of the semicolons in the input string with colons (it could also work the other way around) and then splitting by the remaining character (in this case the colons) Hope this helped, as it is my first answer on Stack overflow. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "758": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69552527/why-append-method-in-python-can-not-be-assigned", "Why append method in python can not be assigned? [duplicate] I'm learning Python and I'm not sure if this problem is specific to the language and how append is implemented in Python. append is a mutating (destructive) operation (it modifies the list in place instead of of returning a new list). The idiomatic way to do the non-destructive equivalent of append would be to answer your question, my guess is that if append returned the newly modified list, users might think that it was non-destructive, ie they might write code like and expect n to be [1,2,3,\"b\"] It is a convention in Python that methods that mutate sequences return None. Consider: Starting in Python 3.3, this is now more explicitly documented: Some collection classes are mutable. The methods that add, subtract,   or rearrange their members in place, and don\u2019t return a specific item,   never return the collection instance itself but None. The Design and History FAQ gives the reasoning behind this design decision (with respect to lists): Why doesn\u2019t list.sort() return the sorted list? In situations where performance matters, making a copy of the list   just to sort it would be wasteful. Therefore, list.sort() sorts the   list in place. In order to remind you of that fact, it does not return   the sorted list. This way, you won\u2019t be fooled into accidentally   overwriting a list when you need a sorted copy but also need to keep   the unsorted version around. In Python 2.4 a new built-in function \u2013 sorted() \u2013 has been added.   This function creates a new list from a provided iterable, sorts it   and returns it. One word of advice would be to avoid using key words or functions as variable names.  In your code above, you use list as a variable: I would advise against using list as a variable name as list is actually already defined as a builtin type.  As ChaseTheSun and squiguy pointed out, there isn't much more to it then It does not return anything. it appends/add to the variable, to see you should use the first variable which used to append in print site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "759": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69552524/how-to-extract-only-certain-fields-from-http-response-object", "How to extract only certain fields from Http response object I'm fairly new to Angular and I'm trying to get only certain values from the Http response object.

I am not sure where the AV happens because delphi has a hard time hitting my breakpoints when the dll is attached to another process. I got it to work yesterday using David Heffernan's answer here: Returning a string from delphi dll to C# caller in 64 bit But my success was short-lived as I changed the string parameters to regular string's (delphi) saw it didn't work and changed them back to to AnsiString (our encryption routine expects Ansi). Since I changed these param types. I have not been able to get it to work again. Here is my Delphi Code: My C# caller: My best bet right now is that I've goofed some of the arguments to the dll since it seems to crash before it reaches an OutputDebugStr() I had put on first line of Encrypt() All help will be greatly appreciated From this docs page: The AnsiString structure contains a 32-bit length indicator, a 32-bit reference count, a 16-bit data length indicating the number of bytes per character, and a 16-bit code page. So an AnsiString isn't simply a pointer to an array of characters -- it's a pointer to a special structure which encodes a bunch of information. However, .NET's P/Invoke machinery is going to pass a pointer to an array of characters. Delphi is going to try and interpret that as a pointer to its special AnsiString structure, and things aren't going to go well. I think you're going to have a hard time using AnsiString in interop. You're better off choosing a string type which both .NET and Delphi know about. If you then need to convert that to AnsiString, do that in Delphi. Change the Delphi function to in order to make this code work. You should probably also make the length argument IN/OUT so that the caller can resize the string builder object once the call returns. That would also allow the callee to signal any errors to the caller, another flaw in your current design. I must also say that using AnsiString as a byte array is a recipe for failure. It's high time you started doing encryption right. If you have text, then encode it as a byte array with a specific encoding, usually this means UTF-8. Then encrypt that byte array to another byte array. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "765": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69552510/how-to-add-flutter-bin-folder", "How to add flutter bin folder?

Kind Regards, Andreas As of jOOQ 3.15, MULTISET are emulated in all dialects using either SQL/XML or SQL/JSON. While the order of XML documents is undefined, some SQL dialects may choose to define an order on JSON documents (e.g. PostgreSQL does it for JSONB). But I'm not convinced it's a good idea in your case to depend on this implicit ordering (specifically, because jOOQ's emulations might change subtly to adapt to some edge cases), so better be explicit about what you want. In standard SQL, you could extract data from your MULTISET nested collection again in order to find some aggregate value like your MIN(...) expression, but that seems quite laborious, and is currently not supported by jOOQ 3.15 (there are some standard SQL operators to operate on multisets, see https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOQ/issues/12031) Since you want to order things by some aggregate value, why not use MULTISET_AGG instead of MULTISET?

The problem with existing questions and answers is that often the question is focused on a nuance that the OP has trouble generalizing in order to use a number of the existing good answers.  However, none of the answers attempt to give a comprehensive explanation (because it's a daunting task) Look a few examples from my Google Search So whenever someone searches for pivot they get sporadic results that are likely not going to answer their specific question. You may notice that I conspicuously named my columns and relevant column values to correspond with how I'm going to pivot in the answers below. Why do I get ValueError: Index contains duplicate entries, cannot reshape How do I pivot df such that the col values are columns, row values are the index, and mean of val0 are the values? How do I pivot df such that the col values are columns, row values are the index, mean of val0 are the values, and missing values are 0? Can I get something other than mean, like maybe sum?

Given, The expected should look something like How do I flatten the multiple index to single index after pivot? From To We start by answering the first question: Why do I get ValueError: Index contains duplicate entries, cannot reshape This occurs because pandas is attempting to reindex either a columns or index object with duplicate entries.  There are varying methods to use that can perform a pivot.  Some of them are not well suited to when there are duplicates of the keys in which it is being asked to pivot on.  For example.  Consider pd.DataFrame.pivot.  I know there are duplicate entries that share the row and col values: So when I pivot using I get the error mentioned above.  In fact, I get the same error when I try to perform the same task with: Here is a list of idioms we can use to pivot pd.DataFrame.groupby + pd.DataFrame.unstack pd.DataFrame.pivot_table pd.DataFrame.set_index + pd.DataFrame.unstack pd.DataFrame.pivot pd.crosstab pd.factorize + np.bincount pd.get_dummies + pd.DataFrame.dot What I'm going to do for each subsequent answer and question is to answer it using pd.DataFrame.pivot_table.  Then I'll provide alternatives to perform the same task. How do I pivot df such that the col values are columns, row values are the index, mean of val0 are the values, and missing values are 0? pd.DataFrame.pivot_table fill_value is not set by default.  I tend to set it appropriately.  In this case I set it to 0.  Notice I skipped question 2 as it's the same as this answer without the fill_value aggfunc='mean' is the default and I didn't have to set it.  I included it to be explicit. pd.DataFrame.groupby pd.crosstab Can I get something other than mean, like maybe sum? pd.DataFrame.pivot_table pd.DataFrame.groupby pd.crosstab Can I do more that one aggregation at a time? Notice that for pivot_table and crosstab I needed to pass list of callables.  On the other hand, groupby.agg is able to take strings for a limited number of special functions.  groupby.agg would also have taken the same callables we passed to the others, but it is often more efficient to leverage the string function names as there are efficiencies to be gained. pd.DataFrame.pivot_table pd.DataFrame.groupby pd.crosstab Can I aggregate over multiple value columns? pd.DataFrame.pivot_table we pass values=['val0', 'val1'] but we could've left that off completely pd.DataFrame.groupby Can Subdivide by multiple columns? pd.DataFrame.pivot_table pd.DataFrame.groupby Can Subdivide by multiple columns? pd.DataFrame.pivot_table pd.DataFrame.groupby pd.DataFrame.set_index because the set of keys are unique for both rows and columns Can I aggregate the frequency in which the column and rows occur together, aka \"cross tabulation\"? pd.DataFrame.pivot_table pd.DataFrame.groupby pd.crosstab pd.factorize + np.bincount pd.get_dummies How do I convert a DataFrame from long to wide by pivoting on ONLY two columns? DataFrame.pivot The first step is to assign a number to each row - this number will be the row index of that value in the pivoted result. This is done using GroupBy.cumcount: The second step is to use the newly created column as the index to call DataFrame.pivot. DataFrame.pivot_table Whereas DataFrame.pivot only accepts columns, DataFrame.pivot_table also accepts arrays, so the GroupBy.cumcount can be passed directly as the index without creating an explicit column.

Trying to update the same binding however triggers an update in the surrounding UI.  This is code produces this behavior: If I hover give my updateUI method a NativeTextView parameter, and use the .text field of it through the parameter, I read the correct value and the UI works correctly:  It seems that the binding retains the ability to write to the outside @State variable but does not manage to access the current states value correctly.

When I've accessed enough files, I start getting a new sandbox error, sandbox_extension_consume returned 12, and after that sandbox sometimes blocks the app from accessing any files. This even happens when creating a minimal document-based app from the Xcode template. Things get saved correctly, and I can access the files I want, but errors start stacking up. Here is a sample project which reproduces the behavior: https://www.dropbox.com/s/9v0v65jbqkjb7ra/Sandboxed%20Doc%20App.zip?dl=1 Create a new document (window only shows the basic template, to keep it minimal) and save it. Sandbox error is immediately logged. Document subclass in the sample is as bare bones as possible: AFAIK, NSDocumentController should support sandboxing without any subclassing. Also, trying to manually stop accessing scoped bookmark of the document URL (after saving or on document close) produces an error. Similar sandbox bug is referred to on Twitter, but I'm hardly accessing couple of files, and not over 4000. What am I doing wrong, or is this a macOS Big Sur bug?

I am relatively new to Python and I need help with implementing Hash table class using Pythons built-in dictionary and appending objects of a file to the hash table and store the name of the objects as key. It must have the methods store and find. I have this class and the methods store and find: I made the class called \"Person\" for the file and assigned the attributes with an index that's their place in the file: Now I want to read my file(which contains names, phone numbers and email addresses), make objects and add them to the hash table with the name as the key. I tried this: However, it doesn't seem to work when trying to search for a key(name) with the find method which means that something went wrong with storing the objects to the hash table. The store method should store data as value in the dictionary, with key(name) as key. How can this be fixed? You are creating hash table per line in csv. You need to create it only once You are re-creating a new HashtableDict for each line in the csv. After the entire loop, you are left with the last created HashtableDict as q.

Should I retrieve a user session when signing in and pass to the next request? How can I handle that? Go's standard library does not provide an HTTP session manager. So you have to write one yourself, or use one written by others. Some examples: Usually HTTP sessions are managed via cookies between server and client, and as such, the session (session id) can be acquired directly from the request (http.Request) e.g. with Request.Cookie(). That being said it is not necessary to \"pass\" the session through the \"request chain\", every handler can access it just by having the http.Request. For example using github.com/icza/session it can be done like this: Using Gorilla sessions, it's similar: site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "819": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69552389/how-i-can-merge-reverted-branch-to-new-branch", "How I can merge reverted branch to new branch?

This is really old subsystem and nobody do anything with architecture for more then 15 years. Now I need to redesign and improve working with to types of DB. And now there are few classes, that creates objects to access DB and fields in every place where needed. I don't like this - because it's more than 25 places, in different binaries, so it's a great example of legasy:) Usually main scenario is working with local database - and some times do a synchronizations with central. And when you do an operation on model - program connects to DB, load data, process and sometimes write it back. So I want to create something like Caching Database Layer that will own a DB connection, and all other operations will ask this layer for data. This DB is small (10-17Mb), so I want to create a cache level, to reduce disk operations. Now I imagine this as a collection of classes: Maybe I need to thing more?

However, when I upload it on my web host environment, I get this error: Fatal error: Call to a member function bind_param() on a non-object in... Here is the code: To check my query, I tried to execute the query via control panel phpMyAdmin and the result is OK. Sometimes your MySQLi code produces an error like mysqli_fetch_assoc() expects parameter..., Call to a member function bind_param()... or similar. Or even without any error, but the query doesn't work all the same. It means that your query failed to execute. Every time a query fails, MySQL has an error message that explains the reason. Unfortunately, by default such errors are not transferred to PHP, and all you've got is a cryptic error message mentioned above.  Hence it is very important to configure PHP and MySQLi to report MySQL errors to you. And once you get the error message, fixing it will be a piece of cake. First of all, always have this line before MySQLi connect in all your environments: After that all MySQL errors will be transferred into PHP exceptions. Uncaught exception, in turn, makes a PHP fatal error. Thus, in case of a MySQL error, you'll get a conventional PHP error. That will instantly make you aware of the error cause. And a stack trace will lead you to the exact spot where the error occurred. Here is a gist of my article on PHP error reporting: Reporting errors on a development and live servers must be different. On a development server it is convenient to have errors shown on-screen, but on a live server error messages must be logged instead, so you could find them in the error log later. Therefore, you must set corresponding configuration options to the following values: On a development server On a production server Just remove any code that checks for the error manually, all those or die(), if ($result) and such. Simply write your database interaction code right away: again, without any conditions around. If an error occurs, it will be treated as any other error in your code. For example, on a development PC it will just appear on-screen, while on a live site it will be logged for a programmer, whereas for the user's convenience you could use an error handler (but that's a different story which is off topic for MySQLi, but you may read about it in the article linked above). First of all you have to locate the problem query. The error message contains the file name and the line number of the exact spot where the error occurred. For the simple code that's enough, but if your code is using functions or classes you may need to follow the stack trace to locate the problem query. After getting the error message, you have to read and comprehend it. It sounds too obvious if not condescending, but learners often overlook the fact that the error message is not just an alarm signal, but it actually contains a detailed explanation of the problem. And all you need is to read the error message and fix the issue. If you don't understand the error message, try to Google it. And when browsing the results, stick to answers that explain the error rather than bluntly give the solution. A solution may not work in your particular case but the explanation will help you to understand the problem and make you able to fix the issue by yourself. You have to also trust the error message. If it says that number of tokens doesn't match the number of bound variables then it is so. The same goes for the absent tables or columns. Given the choice, whether it's your own mistake or the error message is wrong, always stick to the former. Again it sounds condescending, but hundreds of questions on this very site prove this advise extremely useful. P.S. Sometimes there is no error but no results either. Then it means, there is no data in the database to match your criteria. In this case you have to admit this fact, even if you can swear the data and the criteria are all right. They are not. You have to check them again. I've got an article that can help in this matter, How to debug database interactions. Although it is written for PDO, but the principle is the same. Just follow this instruction step by step and either have your problem solved or have an answerable question for Stack Overflow. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "840": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69552349/talend-filter-rows-for-newest-date", "Talend filter rows for newest date I have a table with n entries for each id.

I've experienced this three times in the last day, all three times when opening Pycharm or beginning to train a ML model. But the computer does not get that hot. To exemplify this. It happened just a few minutes ago. I turned on my laptop, opened youtube, had nothing else open. The temperature, CPU, ram, etc. were all at nominal idle levels. Cold to the touch. I opened Pycharm and it had about 30 seconds of indexing it started to do for the packages I have, and in those 30 seconds the thermal throttle was reached and my PC was forcefully shut down. Cool to the touch the entire time. My CPU probably never even hit 150% between the 12 threads/ or 1200% max. No fans, no heat, nothing strenuous.

However, importantly, this will only require \"delegated\" permission (i.e. only permission from the single user, you, to access just data for that single user, you). As a result, you can use \"delegated\" and not \"Application\" permissions, which means that it does -not- require Admin consent for the tenant. It -does- require and Azure Add Application though, at the risk of stating the obvious. While you don't have tenant admin rights, you need to see if you have Azure rights, just to create an application (you might have this anyway as a developer in your org). If you don't even have this, you can sign up for an M365 Developer account, and use that tenant. Importantly - the application does't have to be in the same tenant.

While I reproduced the results in the first post I am unable to apply it to my case: Not sure why you choose the burden to define a specific class here, but your Test class does not define a model, only a single Dense layer; hence, it is not strange that you do not end up with any weights whatsoever. Changing self.h1 to: will do the trick in both cases: Notice that there seem to be changes in different versions, as the frameworks evolve, so some details from old threads might be different today. For example, in the Keras version currently used in Google Colab (2.6.0), model.get_weights() will throw an error if input_dim is not defined - it will not return an empty list: This gives: Finally, as a general remark, you should be careful not to mix functionality from keras and tf.keras; these are different libraries, so choose one and stick to it consistently throughout your code. In your case, I think it all depends on when the call method of tf.keras.Model is actually called. Also, Keras sequential models and subclassing models behave differently. For example if you try the following you will get an output of some weights: or Basically, the call method internally calls the __call__ method. If you check out the official Tensorflow website you can read about this behavior: To call a model on an input, always use the call method, i.e. model(inputs), which relies on the underlying call method.

I have an object which looks like this: I am trying to do a search on all the text inside the values of the object. The some.writer field is an array that can have numerous writers inside. I am currently filtering through like this: That filter looks for the search term inside the object and returns all strings which contain the term or part of the term. The problem is, it only looks at the top level and does not go inside the writers array to search inside there too. How can I do that? See below for an option where you don't need the search array (provided you're doing full-string matches, not substrings), but if you keep the search array then When building it from the something array, I'd also make all the writers lower case (and I'd use toLocaleLowerCase for locale-awareness in the \"to lower\" operation): Then when filtering, instead of building a bunch of intermediate arrays, I'd search more directly: But if you want to make it dynamic so adding new properties to the entries works without modifying the search code (other than when you create search), then as has been pointed out in comments, you can use flat to flatten the array of values so writers is spread out into the top level of the array: Both are fairly simple to tweak to make substring searches: and You might also want to use normalize on the search values and val to handle discrepancies in the different ways some \"characters\" can be represented in Unicode. If so, basically change all the .toLocaleLowerCase() above to .normalize().toLocaleLowerCase(). If you're doing exact matches, you can avoid having to create the search array and doing all those toLowerCase/toLocaleLowerCase calls. This also has the advantage that the search results have the text in its original form. To do that you'd use an Intl.Collator object telling it that you want case-insensitive matching via the sensitivity option: You can use Array.prototype.flat to turn something like [1, [2, 3], 4] into [1, 2, 3, 4]: site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "879": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69552271/modifying-and-validating-fields-in-a-datatable-c-sharp", "Modifying and validating fields in a DataTable c# I have the following datatable:  the field \"court_case\" has a different format and is not compact, the expected format would be: XXXX/XX (\"4 digits\" / \"2 digits\" ) For example: I.e. complete with leading zeros if it is the case for the first part before the \"/\" and with leading zeros if it is the case after the \"/\". with this validation I only check that what comes for court_case is of type integer. but I do not check a validation of the format like: \"XXXX/XX\". here I have to pass the method to validate: I know this is wrong but I don't know how to continue.

Like: You can use string.PadLeft method to append leading zeros 0 (or other char) to some string: Usage example: it will give you that kind of result:  If you just want to check if the input (CourtCase) has the expected format (xxxx/xx) then you could change the Validar_Cc in this way.

There are two processes (in two different containers) that work with the same record. First one updates record status in db transaction and sends message to rabbit queue. Second process fetches record from db and does some job. The problem is that the second process can read the message from the queue before the first process completes the update of the record. Currently, in order to avoid this problem, the second process checks the status of the record, if it does not correspond to the target value, then the process waits for an update by re-sending it to the same queue. This behavior occurs due to the fact that sending to the queue is performed within the transaction context. If I move the sending to the queue outside the transaction, it is possible that an error will occur or the process will be interrupted after the db transaction completed, the status in the database will change, but the message will not be sent to the queue, and the second process will not process this record.

Are there any possible workarounds here? And why doesn't g++ allow to do this? Since the internal lambda has not yet been instantiated, you cannot deduce its return type. One of the workarounds is to pass the lambda itself as a parameter (Godbolt): But this is obviously very redundant, so the better way is to just use the free function for the recursion. See this question for recursive lamda-functions explanation. You can declare your Lambda as std::function<void(std::vector<int>&)> and capture it inside lambda: void doesn't work as the type of a lambda isn't void.

The images and videos are stored on a local network share. The project utilizes two folder paths - one for current images and one for an archive (incl. images of the current date). Both file shares mentioned above are used on separate pages within the same window and basically have the same functionalities. The only difference being that the page responsible for the current images utilizes a FileSystemWatcher to check for new files. When an image is selected, the video can also be played in a separate window; when opening the window with the video player, the Uri of the video file is attached as a parameter. And here is the issue I am having right now... When I open a video from the page with current image files, it works fine, but if I then want to open another video from the page after waiting a while (~2 Minutes), a FileNotFoundException is thrown in the MediaFailed event of the video player. System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Cannot find the media file. ---> System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0xC00D1197): Exception from HRESULT: 0xC00D1197 If I then restart the application and select the same image / video again, it works fine. The problem also doesn't appear if I open different videos without being idle for a certain period of time. The strange thing is that the issue only appears when opening videos from the page with current images, and not the archive (which again, also contains all the current images / videos). All videos work perfectly fine when using the Uri from the archive file share. I already checked if the source is set to the correct path and also disabled the FileSystemWatcher just in case this could cause the issue, but the videos still fail. The current workaround is to set the Uri to the video file from the archive file share if a MediaFailed event occurs, but this is just a band-aid solution. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "961": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69552097/array-variable-not-updated-after-adding-search-condition-in-cakephp-3-437", "Array Variable not updated after adding search condition in cakephp 3.437 I am fetching data in pagination $dogs variable and then passing it into ctp and displaying that data.

Referencing a similar question at Splitting a string into elements of a struct. In a part of my project, I have been entering into signal: segmentation fault (core dumped). My task is to extract a formatted string from a file (which is a line of a file), and convert it into a struct. For example, I have already extracted a string \"t,a,1990\" and I would like to use sscanf to generate a struct s where s.title is \"t\" and so on. I noticed that in the struct given, title and artist are both pointers. I am new to the language and I am wondering why passing a pointer (s.title and s.artist) to a pointer is invalid here. How can I solve it without changing the struct def? Here is my code: Thank you! Each variable represents a specific amount of memory. If you try to use more memory than you've allocated (reserved), segmentation faults happen. In this case, you're 'reading a string to memory', without having allocated any memory to actually hold that memory. The pointer you are supplying does not actually point to anything. As such, either: For the latter case, your struct would look like this: This struct reserves 20 characters for your strings. As long as your strings are shorter than that, you're fine. If it gets longer, you'll run into the same problem as before. Furthermore, the braces in &(s.year) are unnecessary. (&s.year is perfectly fine). If you want to do it 'without changing the structure definition', you will need to work with dynamic memory allocation. The key functions in C for this purpose are malloc and free (which require stdlib.h). As such, your code would become: Failing to call 'free' leads to a memory leak. When you are making the variable s, title and artist have some garbage address from memory, when you are trying to fill them in the sscanf you are placing those strings to that address in memory which you probably don't own. You will need to set the address to memory space you own, for that you can either make 2 strings before, like this: but this isn't really a good looking code, for this purpose there is so called dynamic allocation... you can dynamically allocate memory at runtime with malloc function, that takes a size in bytes and returns address (reference) of the allocated memory: But best way would be to allocate the whole structure at once: Note that the sizes of those strings are limited so I suggest using \"%63s\" instead of \"%s\"... If you are using GCC compiler and you don't care about portability, you don't have to do any of this (well, except freeing the memory in the end), you can allocate the memory directly with the sscanf like this: But with bigger projects I'd use some memory managment library, since malloc might have an impact on performance... Also to read comma separated values use \"%[^,]\" or better %[0-9a-zA-Z ]. This is my go-to site for scanf documentation. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "965": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69552083/python-associate-two-list-of-points-based-on-distance", "Python - Associate two list of points based on distance I have two sets of n points, as Numpy arrays, in random order.

I tried to run this example that uses TensorFlow-neuron 1.15, everything worked without any difficulties, achieved pretty similar results as given in the tutorial. Unfortunately, TensorFlow 1.15 is deprecated and this version is not getting any fixes, updates and etc. I saw that there is TensorFlow 2 for neuron chips, so thought that there should be any difficulties getting similar results. So, not to invent the wheel or not create a pretty different YOLOv4 implementation as used in the mentioned example, I ported the TF1.15 YOLOv4 model to TF2, this was pretty easy. So, the next step was to compile it for neuron, and here problems started, it seems the compiler doesn't give any feedback if it compiled it correctly or not, takes a lot of time, sometimes even EC2 machine hangs and I need to do force stop -> start, to get it working again. Then I started to clip parts of YOLOv4, thinking that maybe there are unsupported operations or etc. But still, it compiles but never runs on all cores, simply on one core... So, my question is, maybe this TF2 neuron package is missing some kind of documentation, how to correctly compile the model, or how to debug it? It's really annoying that I can't get feedback about the compilation process.

I have the code that is effectively similar to https://newbedev.com/fetch-api-data-using-redux-redux-saga-and-axios-code-example and which uses React-Saga(Axios)-Redux. This code has one naming error - it stands: but the correct call is (one should call existing userReceiveAll instead of non-existing getApiData): So, back to my question after this correction. The effective flow of execution is as follows (and it is very idiomatic solution, almost the design pattern): [1.] React component initiates the call to retrieve the external data - effectively REQUEST_API_DATA action is created and forward to Sage for capture and processing: [2.] Saga captures the action, processes it using axios and raises new action that should be processed by Redux Reducer (note correction in naming - use of userReceiveAll): The last function call contains the essence of my question - it call Axios, get data from Axios and immediatly (in hard-coded fashion) transmits them to Redux Reducer for putting into store which is done by the code: After the update of the store content React does its work automatically further and render the retrieved data on a screen (puts inside HTML). My question concerts the hard-coded part: and the code that initiates all this cascade of actions: I don't feel easy about the solution that combines the data fetch and data consumption (sending to the specific variable in the Redux store) in hard-coded and immutable way. We can have the followin (Object-oriented) scenarion: we can have Axios service/Saga method that fetches the Article object. But Redux store can store the retrievied Article in 4 different object hierarchies: SaleItem, SaleOrderItem, Purchase, PurchaseOrderItem. Now, I would like to have the following code in my React Sale component: and the following code in my React Purchase component: Where recalculateSale() and recalculatePurhase() can further be Saga-Axios calling methods, that invokes external services using Axios. Is it possible to this in this Saga/Axios/Redux setting? I understand that I can do such chaining with the async functions that returns Promises and that passes the result of one call as the argument to the next chained async function. But such chaining works for clearly defined async function. Here I have the bunch of mystically defined functions about which I have not yet deciphered which is async function and which is not: e.g. who knows whether requestApiData (as it stands) is async function or not? The same is with the call: can it be promisified into async function which returns promise and made available for the use from React component as, e.g., addGoodToSale() or as addGoodToPurchase()? Of course. I can stay with the hard coded solution and pass additional argument to fetchAll (e.g. fetchType: Sale, SaleOrder, Purchase, PurchaseOrder) and use this type in userReceiveAll: But it is very bad solution, because there are recalculate procedures based on each type afterwards and the code is not maintainable and module. So - my question is: This is pretty common use case in React DB applications and I wonder why there is no design pattern already to handle chain of calls. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1020": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69551945/usefilters-nestjs-doesnt-work-when-rcpexception", "UseFilters NestJS doesn't work when RcpException I'm trying to filter RcpException (from RabbitMQ if it's matter) gateway.ts: rpc-exception-filter.ts: testRMQ.ts: Expected output: Given output: Why filter doesn't work? site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1021": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69551942/how-to-edit-machine-type-in-gcp-cloud-sql", "how to Edit Machine type in GCP cloud SQL I want to reduce machine type in Google cloud sql.

I have also seen similar CSS such as: .some-selector:nth-child(1n); .some-selector:nth-child(2n);  What I glean from the examples from the aforementioned article leads me to posit that .some-selector:nth-child(1n); would equate to .some-selector:nth-child(0); but this also feels wrong to me. Can someone help me to better understand this? Thanks Xn essentially means every Xth child, where Xn+Y is every Xth child with an offset of Y. 1n is quite nonsensical, as it will just select every child (every 1th child, which essentially is just every child).  2n would be every 2nd child, starting with the second child ([0], 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...). Technically this would start with the zeroth child, but there is no such thing in HTML/CSS, so it's functionally equivalent to 2n+2.  2n+1 would be every 2nd child, starting with the first child (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...).  You can specify any Y value in Xn+Y, so if you wanted your every-other selector to start with the 4th element, it would be 2n+4  You can also specify a number in nth-child to directly select whichever child you want.  Your feeling is correct, :nth-child(1n) does not equal :nth-child(0). A selector with an expression like :nth-child(1n), or actually :nth-child(n) which is the same would select all children. So apparently it wouldn't make much sense... To understand which elements are going to be selected you have to give n incremental values starting from 0, as in the table in the article you linked, and all the values you get will be the indexes of the selected elements. There are also some :nth Testers that will help you understand better. .block:nth-child(1n) will target every element with the class block that is a multiple of 1 So it will result the exact same thing as .block{...}  If you want to select only the first one you can use the following  site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1040": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69551897/apply-function-to-variable-subset-of-columns", "Apply function to variable subset of columns Consider this toy data frame: I want to add a new column with the result of a function for each year and each row.

To undersand why this does not work you have to look at the user object: sendTo: sendFrom.bind(this, this.name), This property inside user is what is causing the issue. When this code is run this belongs to the window object and not the user. So finally sendTo is a method with context as window and first param as window.name That is why console.log(this) returns the window object. When you do this: console.log(user.sendTo(\"John\", \"some message\")); You are adding the params \"John\" and \"some message\" after the already appended param.

I am using a combination of columns as a primary key and referencing that primary key in a child table. Since it is a combination of multiple columns, is it necessary to define all the columns in the child table with NOT NULL constraints? E.g., assume that header has a primary key with a hash function of the columns A, B and C, and the line table has a foreign key with a hash function of the columns A, B and C. Is it then necessary that the columns A, B and C column in the child table are NOT NULL? You should consult the documentation: Normally, a referencing row need not satisfy the foreign key constraint if any of its referencing columns are null. If MATCH FULL is added to the foreign key declaration, a referencing row escapes satisfying the constraint only if all its referencing columns are null (so a mix of null and non-null values is guaranteed to fail a MATCH FULL constraint). If you don't want referencing rows to be able to avoid satisfying the foreign key constraint, declare the referencing column(s) as NOT NULL.

I'm wondering if it's better use just style.scss (also if it becomes a big file) or create a css per component. We don't need a specific styles for a specific component. All components, and HTML elements inside them, must have the same styles. What is your \"opionion/style to work\" about it? Personally I prefer to just work with the global styles.scss file. Makes it a lot easier to centrally manage theme colours too which need to be uniform across your app. Only benefit I see to using the stylesheet with each component is when you intend to re-use that component across multiple projects but usually there's not much likelihood that's going to happen. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1080": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69551811/built-in-functions-do-not-update-values-after-script-run", "Built-in functions do not update values after script run COUNT.IF built-in functions in Google Sheets do not update calculations after my script run.

(base 10) and then it gives this and yes im 11 y/o guy that learning c++/c and python 13.10.21: and why string is not appending? I read the code and tried to understand what the goal of the program,here are the things I figured out that is done wrong, I stated them and provided solution for them. The reason why ag=input() is written after the if statement is beacuse you cannot execute the undo command without doing anything. So, you need to do something first, only then you can undo. Right? make sense? So, the error is caused, which is shown from the terminal pic is because, you entered 'undo' as the first command, and since it didn't find any if statement it appended the string 'undo' to rl. (Which is not what we want) Solution : First, Don't enter 'undo' as the first command in the program.(Although, it's the most easy fix but not recommended practice.) Second, Shift the ag=input(\">>\") command directly under two print statements and change the code in if statement as follows : I changed list.pop(-1 to rl.pop(-1) as recommended by @oluwafemi-sule Advice/Recommendation : Usually, when we undo things we don't exit the program/loop, we generally don't break the loop, we skip the rest of the execution, so I fell you should use continue instead of break in  above code Suppose someone entered 'exit' instead of required arguement, hence the program performs the required steps before closing. Now, we want the program to terminate, here in your code there is no termination statement. If we don't terminate the program, 'exit' will  be appended to the rl and again it'll cause error. Hence, your other if statement should have a break statement. That would break the loop and hence complete the execution. I hope I am able to make you understand some of problems in the code, Since I have no way of knowing what this code is used for, I can not execute and give you 100% bug free code.

E.g., I have these types: When I use Entities and EntityType in generics, it noticeably slows down Typescript. It takes several minutes just to display type information in VS Code. I have generic functions like: My understanding of why this is slow is because Entities[T] is a union of all the values of Entities, i.e. User | Post | .... TS doesn't handle unions well. To check that the return type of cached is correct, TS has to iterate through every possible value of T. I.e. if T = 'user', verify that cachedEntity is Entities['user']; if T = 'post', verify that cachedEntity is Entities['post']; and so on. It's slow because TS has to check every value of the union every time I have a generic. In addition, rather than just comparing generics values ('user' === 'user', 'post' === 'post'), TS compares the entire entity (User === User, Post === Post). This makes it worse because the entities are complicated. What are some ways to speed this up? Here are some ideas I have: Remove generics from the intermediate functions and make them return the base entity type, then type cast it. E.g. function getEntityFromCache(type: T, id: number): Entity | null | undefined; Somehow make TS compare the entity type string instead of comparing the entire entities. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1162": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69551637/how-to-i-use-get-document-getelementbyid-for-changing-button-div", "How to I use get document.getElementById for changing button div My code is I want to use in JavaScript and I hope you will understand, How can I add send_request[int_values] in javascript you can do something like site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1163": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69551635/elasticsearch-crash-after-updating-create-doc", "ElasticSearch crash after updating/create doc I have a problem when I want to update my database with around 80 000 products with 11 fields, ES crashed.

When I install my gtag.js code in <head> I'm surprised that I have two scripts loaded. I don't understand why. One is from analytics and the other from googletagmanager: I cant find any info about that. Anybody knows why this happens? The tag manager is a general utility used to load different resources for Google stuff. There are dozens of different resources, including adwords, surveys, A/B testing stuff, analytics, etc (see your tag manager dashboard). In your case, you are only using analytics, so the tag manager only loads the analytics code. Furthermore, each asset is only loaded when a certain \"trigger\" happens. In most cases, the trigger for analytics is \"Page Load\", which is why you are seeing the two requests happen pretty much right next to each other. You could update the trigger to be something like a form submission, youtube video watch, etc... and you would only see the resource loaded when that trigger happens. Gtag.js is Google's \"global\" tag, a sort of scaled down tag manager that only serves Google scripts (and uses the same infrastructure as the tag manager proper, hence googletamanager.com as origin domain). So gtag is the delivery and configuration mechanism, but to do any actual work, the assets for Google Analytics (Google Ads etc, whatever Google script you chose to implement via gtag.js) still have to be loaded. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1186": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69551590/how-do-i-insert-jsonp-into-tbody-without-jquery", "How do I insert JSONP into tbody without jQuery?

A other Array, containing rules for some / specific users. So for each user, which has a rule in the rules array, update a field on the user object. This was the original Code: user.ID and rule.UserID are the Same. Note:  This is \"meaningless\" Code Is there any \"elegant\" way to solve that ? Thanks in advance. You are trying to do too much in a few statements. This makes your code difficult to read, difficult to reuse, difficult to change and difficult to unit test. Consider to make it a habit to make small reusable methods. How can i compare two arrays, and perform an action on the Elements that are in both? LINQ can only extract data from your source data. LINQ cannot change the source data. To change the source data, you should enumerate the data that you extracted using LINQ. This is usually done using foreach. So you have two sequences of Secrets, and you want to extract all Secrets that are in both sequences. First of all, you need to specify: when is a Secret in both sequences: It is clear that a and b refer to the same object. Although the values of all properties and fields in Secret a and Secret c are equal, they are different instances. The effect is, that if you change the value of one of the properties of Secret a, then the value is also changed in Secret b. However, Secret C remains unchanged. It is clear that you want a in your end result. You also want b, because a and b refer to the same object. It is also clear that you don't want d, nor e in your end result. But are in your opinion a and c equal? Another ambiguity in your requirements: How many times do you want a in your end result? By default a and c are different objects, a == c yields false. However if you want to define them equal, you need to say in your LINQ: do not use the standard definition for equality, use my definition of equality. For this we need to write an Equality Comparer. Or to be more precise: create an object of a class that implement IEqualityComparer<Secret>. Luckily this is usually quite straightforward. Definition: Two objects of type Secret are equal if all properties return the same value. Implementation is below The reason that I derive from class EqualityComparer<Secret>, and not just implement IEqualityComparer<Secret>, is that class EqualityComparer also give me property Default, which might be useful if you want to use the default definition when comparing two Secrets. Once you have the equality comparer, LINQ will be straightforward. To extract the Secrets that are in both x and y, I use the overload of  Enumerable.Intersect that uses an equality comparer: That's all. To perform an action on every remaining Secret, use foreach: So your complete code: Or if you want to do this in one statement. Not sure if this improves readability: The nice thing about separating creation of x and y, how you comparison, extracting the common Secrets and performing the action on all remaining secrets, is that most procedure will be quite small, hence easy to read. All procedure can be reused for other purposes. You can easily change them (different definition of equality: write a different comparer!), and easy to unit test. Most of the time often we don't want that different derived classes are equal: So a TopSecret (derived from Secret) is not equal to a Secret. The rest depends on your definition of when two Secrets are equal. Most of the time you check all properties. Sometimes you only check a subsection. Here you can see that the code depends on your definition of equality. Maybe the Description check is case insensitive: This method is mainly used to have a fast method to determine that two objects are not equal. A good GetHashCode is fast, and throws away most unequal objects. There is only one requirement: if x and y are considered equal, they should return the same HashCode. Not the other way round: different objects might have the same Hashcode, although it would be better if they have different HashCodes. How about this: In the code above, I assume that there the Id of a Secret is fairly unique. Probably only while updating a Secret you will find two non-equal Secrets with same Id: Now existingSecret and secretToEdit have the same value for Id, but a different Description. Hence they are not equal. Yet they have the same HashCode. Still, by far most Secrets will have a unique Id, GetHashCode will be a very fast method to detect that two Secrets are different. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1192": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69551569/in-pyplot-hist2d-with-customized-colorbar-mark-bins-outside-colorbar-range", "in pyplot hist2D with customized colorbar mark bins outside colorbar range I'm plotting a weighted 2D histogram with one value assigned to each bin.

The tree is like: The total number of the leave node should be 3 which is (12,10,5), but the result of my code is 2. Can I know what wrong with my code and how to fix it. Big Thanks! Some issues: When the for loop variable gets to equal size you will have an out of bounds index-access to data. The loop should exit in that case -- size is an invalid index, so use i < size as loop condition. Your for loop increments the loop variable with i++; there should be no reason to increment i on top of that when you find a -1 value in the data. What if i will be out of bounds by doing that? What if the next data element also has a -1 value? In either case your code goes wrong. Instead use data[i] != -1 as a condition for the rest of the logic in the loop's body. You should check that the index you use for data is not out of bounds, before actually making that index access. It is not safe to compare an out of bounds data entry with NULL: the value of an out of bounds access is undefined and int should never have to be compared with NULL. NULL is used in the context of pointers. You should also foresee the case where the left child is -1 and the right child is out of bounds. Here is a fix for those issues: This logic assumes that the array will be organised like a complete tree. Some array encodings like this will not have two -1 entries for filling up the \"children\" of another -1 entry, but just omit them, making the formula 2*i+1 and 2*i+2 invalid. Take for example this tree: If the encoding is a complete tree encoding, then it will be {1, -1, 2, -1, -1, -1, 3}. If it is the more compact encoding where -1 entries will not have children entries, then it will be {1, -1, 2, -1, 3}. Your example does not show which of the two encodings you are dealing with as it would turn out to be the same array for your example tree. If it is the later encoding, you need a different algorithm altogether. You have made several mistakes in your program. Some of the mistakes are: Please correct these mistakes and ask again.

The data returned by endpoint_2 is then going to be retrieved by my frontend and rendered to the user. What's the best recommended way to send the data from endpoint_1 to endpoint_2 in Fast API? I've thought about the following: Save the data in some local DB in endpoint_1 and retrieve it back in endpoint_2. After retrieving the data, delete the attributes from DB. This seems like having a lot of overhead for just keeping one table that's really ever going to have one record. Save the data using some cache mechanism (Redis / Memcached) but then again, configuring this just to keep this seems also peculiar.

Here's the sample command line I used, based on the examples in the blog: As an aside, I had to learn about applying a format file to prevent a prefix string from being inserted into the file.  This format file must be in BCP's older format, because the newer XML version of the format file has a schema entry for \"PREFIX_LENGTH\" that prevents a 0 value. I would rather use PowerShell to extract the blobs, but the following code based on a TechNet article takes about two days to process instead of BCP's 20 seconds for the same 2 gig blob. It does eventually finish, but I don't know why the script takes so long to complete. Does anyone have an idea why the PowerShell script is being neutered? You don't need the BinaryWriter at all. That class is only meant to write primitive types like integers, doubles, strings etc in a .NET-specific format. It's rarely used. If you want to write bytes to a file all you need is to use Stream.Write : A better idea that can eliminate almost all the code is to use DbDataReader.GetStream instead of GetBytes to read the BLOB as a stream.

Your function is void and returns nothing that why you cannot use a method of class continuously. You need to change the return type from void to Complex & And you should pass a ref instead of value. You can ref this link for more information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface You are close. As mentioned in the comments, your addtwo() function needs to return a reference to the class being added. You can do that by returning the dereferenced this pointer for that instance. Since this is a pointer to the current instance, to return a reference to type Complex you will need to dereference this removing the one level of pointer indirection making the return type Complex, e.g. While using a setter is fine to provide the initial values to the instance of your class, you really ought to write a constructor for the class to accomplish the same thing. You can add default value of 0 for each real_ and imag_ at that point, e.g. Now you can initialize the Complex instances at the time they are created, e.g. in main() Adding a friend function for std::ostream& is a simple way to provide stream-based output operator for your Commplex type, e.g. Putting it altogether, you can write what you are attempting as follows, initializing each instance of Complex through the constructor while having your set() function available to change values for an instance, if needed.

It has at most 30 entries, for each of the last 30 days one. My problem is that some dates are missing - I want to see: What I need from the single query is to get: 19,21,9,14,0,0,10,0,0,14... That means that the missing dates are filled with 0. I know how to get all the values and in server side language iterating through dates and missing the blanks. But is this possible to do in mysql, so that I sort the result by date and get the missing pieces. EDIT: In this table there is another column named UserID, so I have 30.000 users and some of them have the score in this table. I delete the dates every day if date < 30 days ago because I need last 30 days score for each user. The reason is I am making a graph of the user activity over the last 30 days and to plot a chart I need the 30 values separated by comma. So I can say in query get me the USERID=10203 activity and the query would get me the 30 scores, one for each of the last 30 days. I hope I am more clear now. MySQL doesn't have recursive functionality, so you're left with using the NUMBERS table trick - Create a table that only holds incrementing numbers - easy to do using an auto_increment: Populate the table using: ...for as many values as you need. Use DATE_ADD to construct a list of dates, increasing the days based on the NUMBERS.id value.  Replace \"2010-06-06\" and \"2010-06-14\" with your respective start and end dates (but use the same format, YYYY-MM-DD) - LEFT JOIN onto your table of data based on the time portion: If you want to maintain the date format, use the DATE_FORMAT function: I'm not a fan of the other answers, requiring tables to be created and such. This query does it efficiently without helper tables. So lets dissect this. The if will detect days that had no score and set them to 0. b.Days is the configured amount of days you chose to get from the current date, up to 1000. This subquery is something I saw on stackoverflow. It efficiently generates a list of the past 1000 days from the current date. The interval (currently 30) in the WHERE clause at the end determines which days are returned; the maximum is 1000. This query could be easily modified to return 100s of years worth of dates, but 1000 should be good for most things. This is the part that brings your table that contains the score into it. You compare to the selected date range from the date generator query to be able to fill in 0s where needed (the score will be set to NULL initially, because it is a LEFT JOIN; this is fixed in the select statement). I also order it by the dates, just because. This is preference, you could also order by score. Before the ORDER BY you could easily join with your table about user info you mentioned with your edit, to add that last requirement. I hope this version of the query helps someone. Thanks for reading. Time went by since this question was asked. MySQL 8.0 was released in 2018 and added support for recursive common table expressions, which provide an elegant, state-of-the-art way to solve this question. The following query can be used to generate a list of dates, say for the first 15 days of August 2010: You can then left join this resultset with your table to generate the expected output: Demo on DB Fiddle: You can accomplish this by using a Calendar Table. That's a table which you create once and fill with a date range (e.g. one dataset for each day 2000-2050; that depends on your data). Then you can make an outer join of your table against the calendar table. If a date is missing in your table, you return 0 for the score.

To authenticate with the server the client must send a JWT in the request headers, set as \"authorization\". The token is valid for 30 minutes. After the token has expired, the server will terminate the connection. I am looking for a way to refresh my authorization token from the client, and keep the stream open. The client should run in a loop executing a new request every 30 minutes with the updated token, and the updated payload. I have not seen a way to update a header from the client side for an already opened stream. Let's look at some code to get an idea of what the client side looks like. The code below has a function to create a new instance of the client, and another function to establish the connection to the GRPC server. Looking at the newConnection function above we can see that there is a call to another function, newTokenAuth, to create an auth token, which works great. This func returns a struct that implements the PerRPCCredentials interface. There are two ways to set the authorization for a request. Use grpc.WithPerRPCCredentials to add the authorization at the time of creating the connection to the server. Use grpc.PerRPCCredentials to add the authorization to each stream opened on the connection to the server. In this case, I am using grpc.WithPerRPCCredentials to attach the token at the time of creating the connection to the server. Now, let's take a look at the definition of PerRPCCredentials. The interface requires that you define two methods. The documentation of GetRequestMetadata says GetRequestMetadata gets the current request metadata, refreshing tokens if required So, it looks like my implementation of PerRPCCredentials should be able to handle a token refresh for my stream or connection. Let's take a look at my implementation of PerRPCCredentials. As you can see, the call to GetRequestMetadata will establish a go routine that will attempt to refresh a token every 25 minutes. Adding a go routine right here is probably not the right way to do it. It was an attempt to get the auth header to refresh, which doesn't work. Let's take a look at the stream. The client sends a message on the stream every 25 minutes. All I'm looking to get here is that when stream.Send is called, the updated token is also sent. This function, GetRequestMetadata only gets called once, regardless if I am setting the auth through grpc.WithPerRPCCredentials or grpc.PerRPCCredsCallOption so there appears to be no way to update the authorization header. If you have any idea what I have missed in my attempt to utilize the PerRPCCredentials for token refresh, or if you know of another way that it can be done, maybe through an interceptor or some other means then please let me know.

The format is something like 37423 = -212, -210, 276 where, in this case, 37423 is the number of the device type and -212, -210, 276 are the IDs. Now, I have a code that scans this type of file and adds into a list the IDs: where manufacturedid is 37423 and tmp_d are -212, -210, 276 My issue is that when it .append(tmp_d) is a negative number, it converts into a positive one and I can't understand why as the tmp_d in the if not statement should be negative as well. EDIT: I think the issue is in the for d loop as d results always positive You did as you are dealing with ASCII text we can say \\W is simply [^a-zA-Z0-9_], thus it was also match and remove -, for example output Read python re built-in module docs, if you want to know more about \\W.

I'm currently developing a JavaEE app using JAX-RS and in the process of exposing various resources I'm faced with the following design dilemma that I haven't found a proper answer to. Two entities, Customer and Address, are interconnected with the One-To-One, Total Participation relationship, meaning one Address per Customer. Deriving from these I created a resource CustomerResource that exposes various endpoints relating to the Customer entity that lead to basic CRUD operations. Some of these endpoints are: The problem arises when I create the second resource AddressResource which will handle endpoints relating to operations for the Address entity. This entity cannot exist without a Customer and as such I came to the decision to convey that using nested URI scheme, as opposed to using QueryParams. Now, as you can imagine, some of the endpoints that the AddressResource exposes are: I'm faced with validating IF the Customer ID exists and then continuing on to the actual operation that the endpoint entails. Looking the app design from a top down viewpoint, right after the Resource classes come the Service classes. For each Resource class there is a Service class which carry out any necessary business logic and call for the DAO classes to reflect all the necessary changes to the physical DB and the persistence context. So, any validation happens on the Service layer. The thing is that the AddressService class will have to make a call to check if the Customer exists using the CustomerDao class, which queries the database for the given customerId and returns its findings. If the customer exists then the AddressDao gets called to perform the corresponding query on the DB relating to the Address entities. So, in a sense, I want to avoid the coupling of the Service classes passing calls to multiple Dao classes, as well as, avoid any duplicate code that validation for multiple resources might lead to. This is due to the fact that I want to introduce a new One-To-Many resource that also requires validation on the customerId level and this would entail its Service class also calling the CustomerDao. I'm aware of the N+1 query problem and I'm keeping the nested resource depth at a maximum of 2. The validation would have to be performed regardless of the URI design as it derives from the Total Participation rule. Sry for the long and maybe oversimplified explanation of the problem and thank you all in advance! First, \"One-To-One, Total Participation relationship, meaning one Address per Customer\" also means \"just one Customer at one Address\". In this case you don't need separate Entity for Address, it might be the part of Customer. So, let me suppose, you meant One-To-Many relation: \"many Customers at one Address\". Didn't you? In this case you can create Addresses as a dictionary with separate resource then bind that to some Customers with web-method of Customer resource. Finally, to avoid code duplication you can encapsulate business logic within appropriate facades then inject those anywhere you need like: site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1331": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69551259/where-does-user-private-key-is-stored-in-fabric-ca-in-user-key-generation-proces", "Where does user private key is stored in fabric-ca in user key generation process I am using fabric ca-client to to register and enroll the \"user\" to interact with the chaincode.

I have an application that was crashing when I run it in the container, but when I tried to specify --memory 2048mb parameter to the docker run command it seems to run fine. At least in the scenario where it was crashing before. This gives me impression that there is default memory limit, but I could not find it in the documentation. So my question is there memory limit and if it is where it is documented? According to talks on Docker for windows Github issues (https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/31604), when Docker for Windows is run under Windows 10, it is actually using a Hyper-V isolation model (and process model is not accessible in Win 10 scenario). And in that isolation type, your container is run inside a lightweight VM, which DOES have a default limit, and it is 1 Gb. So if you want to have more memory you should use -m param. For me, on Windows 10 using Docker Desktop, I could not get the --memory= and --cpus= options to work.  Here's what does work:  Surprise! Surprise! I have 32Gb RAM on my host but I can see only 1Gb RAM given to Windows containers: The same limit on images made from: I think it's coming from the Hyper-V layer in --isolation=hyperv mode, where a container is some sort of lightweight VM. You can check isolation mode used for your existing container by docker inspect command. NOTE: Switching to Linux containers and playing with the \"Settings Resources > Advanced\" options only modifies the VM resources for running Linux containers, and not Windows containers. To adjust the amount of memory and CPU cores used for Windows containers you will need to use the --memory and  --cpus argument flags when you run the image. For example: Do NOT forget to append an \"m\" with number you set for the --memory flag as in \"4096m\" or it will have no effect. Also the memory flag has a short version -m 4096m. You can verify that setting the flags worked by opening a Powershell terminal to the running container: To check memory, run: To check CPUs, run: This article really helped me figure it out: https://www.sqlservercentral.com/blogs/default-resource-limits-for-windows-vs-linux-containers-in-docker-desktop Run Docker QuickStart Terminal Remove the default vm: Re-create the default vm: Depending on your requirements you can change the values for different parameters below. Then do Now open the Docker quickstart terminal again Now when you run and create a new container you will have more ram memory by default. But be careful it will delete already all pulled docker images. We recently had a very similar problem and question and therefore made some experiments with docker memory on windows: It seems that it heavily depends on you configuration.  If you run docker containers in, lets call it hyper-v mode, the memory limit seems to be about 512mb. You can extend the given memory with the \"-m\" option for docker run. Assigning 2 gb have not been a problem. Unfortunately, its totally different for windows server containers. There the starting memory limit is 1gb and you can decrease it with the \"-m\" option. We did not find a way to increase the memory for those containers. How you see your mode/isolation level: hyperv - hyper-v mode; process is windows server Some additional notes: Its very hard to find a command that outputs the available memory in a container. We had created our own performance test for reliable results. I think it might be that you have too much dead containers. Maybe try docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) to remove all the exited container then retry running the container you want. No default limits.

I have the following code running in an event loop where I'm downloading a large number of files using asyncio and restricting the number of files downloaded using asyncio.queue: This code seems to run fine, but I originally had the for loop defined as: With this code, the result is the same but I get the following warning: Looking at asyncio examples, sometimes I see create_task() used when creating a list or queue of coroutines to be run in gather and sometimes I don't. Why is it needed in my case and what's the best practice for using it? Edit: As @user2357112supportsMonica discourteously pointed out, the return statement within worker() doesn't really make sense. The point of this code is to limit concurrency because I may have to download thousands at a time and would like to limit it to 10 at a time using the queue. So my actual question is, how can I use gather to return all my results using this queue implementation? Edit 2: I seemed to have found an easy solution that works using a semaphore instead of a queue with the following code adapted from this answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/61478547/4844593: As \"user2357112 supports Monica\" notes, the original issue probably comes from the workers having a return so each worker will download one file then quit, meaning any coroutines after the first 10 will be ignored and never awaited (you can probably see that if you log information about download_tasks after the supposed completion of your processing). The create_tasks defeats that because it will immediately schedule the downloading at the same time (defeating the attempted rate limiting / workers pool), then the incorrect worker code will just ignore anything after the first 10 items. Anyway the difference between coroutines (e.g. bare async functions) and tasks is that tasks are independently scheduled. That is, once you've created a task it lives its life independently and you don't have to await it if you don't want its result. That is similar to Javascript's async functions. coroutines, however, don't do anything until they are awaited, they will only progress if they are explicitelly polled and that is only done by awaiting them (directly or indirectly e.g. gather or wait will await/poll the objects they wrap). site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1359": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69551178/django-filter-deep-related-models", "Django filter deep related models In my Django 3.2 app, my models have the following relations: Now, when I create a new OperationDrat I have to limit the choice of the structure based on the user of its customer.

I think there is a simple solution to this, but I can't find it. In the future my QUERY_STRING will get bigger and it will look like this: You want the second through seventh \"fields\" (so to speak) from the query string? I'd use awk to do the split-select-merge operation: The awk program splits fields on &, and prints two through seven with ',' (the output field separator) between them. There are also single-quotes at the beginning and end, outside the whole $( ). And then just use that in the actual query: Note that I would recommend using lower- or mixed-case variable names (i.e. query_string instead of QUERY_STRING) to avoid conflicts with the many all-caps names with special meanings. Also, you should almost always double-quote variable references (e.g. echo \"$QUERY_STRING\" instead of echo $QUERY_STRING) to avoid weird parsing. I always recommend running scripts through shellcheck.net to check for mistakes like missing double-quotes. BTW, since that QUERY_STRING looks a lot like it came from a URL, and therefore from some web-ish client, it's probably from an untrustworthy source. Putting untrusted data directly into an SQL query is the classic way to get an SQL injection vulnerability (obligatory relevant xkcd). You should be sure to validate the data before letting it near your database. If I understand the format of the string, something like this should work: That regex pattern looks for something that starts with \"u=\", then has some mix of \".\", \"&\", letters, and digits.

So say for example that the user clicks on my menu on the main form: Tools -> Options, this would cause my options form to be shown. My question is how can I send data from my options form back to my main form? I know I could use properties, but I have a lot of options and this seems like an tedious odd thing to do. So what is the best way? Form1 triggers Form2 to open. Form2 has overloaded constructor which takes calling form as argument and provides its reference to Form2 members. This solves the communication problem. For example I've exposed Label Property as public in Form1 which is modified in Form2. With this approach you can do communication in different ways. Download Link for Sample Project //Your Form1 //Your Form2 (source: ruchitsurati.net) (source: ruchitsurati.net) In the comments to the accepted answer, Neeraj Gulia writes: This leads to tight coupling of the forms Form1 and Form2, I guess instead one should use custom events for such kind of scenarios. The comment is exactly right. The accepted answer is not bad; for simple programs, and especially for people just learning programming and trying to get basic scenarios to work, it's a very useful example of how a pair of forms can interact. However, it's true that the coupling that example causes can and should be avoided, and that in the particular example, an event would accomplish the same thing in a general-purpose, decoupled way. Here's an example, using the accepted answer's code as the baseline: Form1.cs: The above code creates a new instance of Form2, and then before showing it, adds an event handler to that form's Button1Click event. Note that the expression (sender, e) => Lbl.Text = ((Form2)sender).Message is converted automatically by the compiler to a method that looks something similar to (but definitely not exactly like) this: There are actually lots of ways/syntaxes to implement and subscribe the event handler. For example, using an anonymous method as the above, you don't really need to cast the sender parameter; instead you can just use the frm local variable directly: (sender, e) => Lbl.Text = frm.Message. Going the other way, you don't need to use an anonymous method. You could in fact just declare a regular method just like the compiler-generated one I show above, and then subscribe that method to the event: frm.Button1Click += frm_Message; (where you have of course used the name frm_Message for the method, just as in my example above). Regardless of how you do it, of course you will need for Form2 to actually implement that Button1Click event. That's very simple\u2026 Form2.cs: In addition to the event, I've also declared a property Message that exposes the Text property (and only the Text property, and only as read-only in fact) of the txtMessage control. This allows the subscriber to the event to get the value and do whatever it needs to with it. Note that all that the event does is to alert the subscriber that the button has in fact been clicked. It's up to the subscriber to decide how to interpret or react to that event (e.g. by retrieving the value of the Message property and assigning it to something). Alternatively, you could in fact deliver the text along with the event itself, by declaring a new EventArgs sub-class and using that for the event instead: Then the subscriber can just retrieve the message value directly from the event object:  The important thing note in all of the above variations is that at no point does the class Form2 need to know anything about Form1. Having Form1 know about Form2 is unavoidable; after all, that's the object that will create a new Form2 instance and use it. But the relationship can be asymmetrical, with Form2 being usable by any object that needs the features it offers. By exposing the functionality as an event (and optionally with a property), it makes itself useful without limiting its usefulness to only the Form1 class. The best in this case would be to have some OptionsService class/interface that is accessible via IServiceProvider. Just add an event when something changes, and the rest of the app can respond to it. There are lots of ways to perform communication between two Forms.  Some of them have already been explained to you. I am showing you the other way around. Assuming you have to update some settings from the child form to the parent form. You can make use of these two ways as well : Using System.Action You can think of it as a callback function passed to the child form. OpenForms Method This method is easy (2 lines). But only works with forms that are open. All you need to do is add these two lines where ever you want to pass some data. Properties is one option, shared static class - another option, events - another option... You might try AutoMapper.  Keep your options in a separate class and then use AutoMapper to shuttle the data between the class and the form. Create a Class and put all your properties inside the class .. Create a Property in the parent class and set it from your child (options) form You can have a function in Form B like so: And you can call it like this: MVC, MVP, MVVM -- slight overkill for someone admittedly saying they want tutorials.  Those are theories that have entire courses dedicated to them. As already posted, passing an object around is probably easiest.  If treating a class as an object (interchangeable in this sense) is new, then you may want to spend another 2-4 weeks figuring out properties and constructors and such. I'm not a C# master by any means, but these concepts need to be pretty concrete if you want to go much further beyond passing values between two forms (also classes/objects in their own right).  Not trying to be mean here at all, it just sounds like you're moving from something like VB6 (or any language with globals) to something far more structured. Eventually, it will click. This is probably sidestepping your problem a little bit, but my settings dialog uses the Application Settings construct. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k4s6c3a0.aspx I can't find a good example that's similar to how I do it (which is actually having an actual class+object), but this covers another way of doing it: Reading default application settings in C# A form is a class, just like any other class.  Add some public variables to your form class and set them when they click the button to close the form (technically they are just hiding it). A VB.NET example, but you'll get the idea - In your OptionsForm class: etc. Set them when they hit the \"Ok\" button. So in your main form, when they hit the \"options\" button - you create your options form: when it exits, you harvest your option settings from the public variables on the form: etc. The best way to deal with communication between containers is to implement an observer class The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.  (Wikipedia) the way i do this is creating an Observer class, and inside it write something like this: so basically: the first line says that there would be a function that somebody else will implement the second line is creating an event that occurs when the delegated function will call and the third line is the creation of the function that calls the event so in your UserControl, you should add a function like this: and in your Form you should do something like: and now, you can register this function to a whole bunch of other controls and containers and they will all get the signal I hope this would help :) site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1382": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69551138/removing-quotes-and-escaped-quotes-from-string-value", "Removing Quotes and escaped quotes from string value [duplicate] I'm having a really embarrasing moment, as this feels like it's super simple but I just cannot seem to figure out what the best solution is, (or one at all for that matter).

Binary floating point math is like this. In most programming languages, it is based on the IEEE 754 standard. The crux of the problem is that numbers are represented in this format as a whole number times a power of two; rational numbers (such as 0.1, which is 1/10) whose denominator is not a power of two cannot be exactly represented. For 0.1 in the standard binary64 format, the representation can be written exactly as In contrast, the rational number 0.1, which is 1/10, can be written exactly as The constants 0.2 and 0.3 in your program will also be approximations to their true values.  It happens that the closest double to 0.2 is larger than the rational number 0.2 but that the closest double to 0.3 is smaller than the rational number 0.3.  The sum of 0.1 and 0.2 winds up being larger than the rational number 0.3 and hence disagreeing with the constant in your code. A fairly comprehensive treatment of floating-point arithmetic issues is What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic. For an easier-to-digest explanation, see floating-point-gui.de. Side Note: All positional (base-N) number systems share this problem with precision Plain old decimal (base 10) numbers have the same issues, which is why numbers like 1/3 end up as 0.333333333... You've just stumbled on a number (3/10) that happens to be easy to represent with the decimal system, but doesn't fit the binary system. It goes both ways (to some small degree) as well: 1/16 is an ugly number in decimal (0.0625), but in binary it looks as neat as a 10,000th does in decimal (0.0001)** - if we were in the habit of using a base-2 number system in our daily lives, you'd even look at that number and instinctively understand you could arrive there by halving something, halving it again, and again and again. ** Of course, that's not exactly how floating-point numbers are stored in memory (they use a form of scientific notation). However, it does illustrate the point that binary floating-point precision errors tend to crop up because the \"real world\" numbers we are usually interested in working with are so often powers of ten - but only because we use a decimal number system day-to-day. This is also why we'll say things like 71% instead of \"5 out of every 7\" (71% is an approximation, since 5/7 can't be represented exactly with any decimal number). So no: binary floating point numbers are not broken, they just happen to be as imperfect as every other base-N number system :) Side Side Note: Working with Floats in Programming In practice, this problem of precision means you need to use rounding functions to round your floating point numbers off to however many decimal places you're interested in before you display them. You also need to replace equality tests with comparisons that allow some amount of tolerance, which means: Do not do if (x == y) { ... } Instead do if (abs(x - y) < myToleranceValue) { ... }. where abs is the absolute value. myToleranceValue needs to be chosen for your particular application - and it will have a lot to do with how much \"wiggle room\" you are prepared to allow, and what the largest number you are going to be comparing may be (due to loss of precision issues). Beware of \"epsilon\" style constants in your language of choice. These are not to be used as tolerance values. I believe I should add a hardware designer\u2019s perspective to this since I design and build floating point hardware. Knowing the origin of the error may help in understanding what is happening in the software, and ultimately, I hope this helps explain the reasons for why floating point errors happen and seem to accumulate over time. From an engineering perspective, most floating point operations will have some element of error since the hardware that does the floating point computations is only required to have an error of less than one half of one unit in the last place. Therefore, much hardware will stop at a precision that's only necessary to yield an error of less than one half of one unit in the last place for a single operation which is especially problematic in floating point division. What constitutes a single operation depends upon how many operands the unit takes. For most, it is two, but some units take 3 or more operands. Because of this, there is no guarantee that repeated operations will result in a desirable error since the errors add up over time. Most processors follow the IEEE-754 standard but some use denormalized, or different standards . For example, there is a denormalized mode in IEEE-754 which allows representation of very small floating point numbers at the expense of precision. The following, however, will cover the normalized mode of IEEE-754 which is the typical mode of operation. In the IEEE-754 standard, hardware designers are allowed any value of error/epsilon as long as it's less than one half of one unit in the last place, and the result only has to be less than one half of one unit in the last place for one operation. This explains why when there are repeated operations, the errors add up. For IEEE-754 double precision, this is the 54th bit, since 53 bits are used to represent the numeric part (normalized), also called the mantissa, of the floating point number (e.g. the 5.3 in 5.3e5). The next sections go into more detail on the causes of hardware error on various floating point operations. The main cause of the error in floating point division is the division algorithms used to calculate the quotient. Most computer systems calculate division using multiplication by an inverse, mainly in Z=X/Y, Z = X * (1/Y).  A division is computed iteratively i.e. each cycle computes some bits of the quotient until the desired precision is reached, which for IEEE-754 is anything with an error of less than one unit in the last place. The table of reciprocals of Y (1/Y) is known as the quotient selection table (QST) in the slow division, and the size in bits of the quotient selection table is usually the width of the radix, or a number of bits of the quotient computed in each iteration,  plus a few guard bits. For the IEEE-754 standard, double precision (64-bit), it would be the size of the radix of the divider, plus a few guard bits k, where k>=2. So for example, a typical Quotient Selection Table for a divider that computes 2 bits of the quotient at a time (radix 4) would be 2+2= 4 bits (plus a few optional bits). 3.1 Division Rounding Error: Approximation of Reciprocal What reciprocals are in the quotient selection table depend on the division method: slow division such as SRT division, or fast division such as Goldschmidt division; each entry is modified according to the division algorithm in an attempt to yield the lowest possible error. In any case, though, all reciprocals are approximations of the actual reciprocal and introduce some element of error. Both slow division and fast division methods calculate the quotient iteratively, i.e. some number of bits of the quotient are calculated each step, then the result is subtracted from the dividend, and the divider repeats the steps until the error is less than one half of one unit in the last place. Slow division methods calculate a fixed number of digits of the quotient in each step and are usually less expensive to build, and fast division methods calculate a variable number of digits per step and are usually more expensive to build. The most important part of the division methods is that most of them rely upon repeated multiplication by an approximation of a reciprocal, so they are prone to error. Another cause of the rounding errors in all operations are the different modes of truncation of the final answer that IEEE-754 allows. There's truncate, round-towards-zero, round-to-nearest (default), round-down, and round-up. All methods introduce an element of error of less than one unit in the last place for a single operation. Over time and repeated operations, truncation also adds cumulatively to the resultant error. This truncation error is especially problematic in exponentiation, which involves some form of repeated multiplication. Since the hardware that does the floating point calculations only needs to yield a result with an error of less than one half of one unit in the last place for a single operation, the error will grow over repeated operations if not watched. This is the reason that in computations that require a bounded error, mathematicians use methods such as using the round-to-nearest even digit in the last place of IEEE-754, because, over time, the errors are more likely to cancel each other out, and Interval Arithmetic combined with variations of the IEEE 754 rounding modes to predict rounding errors, and correct them. Because of its low relative error compared to other rounding modes, round to nearest even digit (in the last place), is the default rounding mode of IEEE-754. Note that the default rounding mode, round-to-nearest even digit in the last place, guarantees an error of less than one half of one unit in the last place for one operation. Using the truncation, round-up, and round down alone may result in an error that is greater than one half of one unit in the last place, but less than one unit in the last place, so these modes are not recommended unless they are used in Interval Arithmetic. In short, the fundamental reason for the errors in floating point operations is a combination of the truncation in hardware, and the truncation of a reciprocal in the case of division. Since the IEEE-754 standard only requires an error of less than one half of one unit in the last place for a single operation, the floating point errors over repeated operations will add up unless corrected. It's broken in the exact same way the decimal (base-10) notation you learned in grade school is broken, just for base-2. To understand, think about representing 1/3 as a decimal value. It's impossible to do exactly! In the same way, 1/10 (decimal 0.1) cannot be represented exactly in base 2 (binary) as a \"decimal\" value; a repeating pattern after the decimal point goes on forever. The value is not exact, and therefore you can't do exact math with it using normal floating point methods. Most answers here address this question in very dry, technical terms. I'd like to address this in terms that normal human beings can understand. Imagine that you are trying to slice up pizzas. You have a robotic pizza cutter that can cut pizza slices exactly in half. It can halve a whole pizza, or it can halve an existing slice, but in any case, the halving is always exact. That pizza cutter has very fine movements, and if you start with a whole pizza, then halve that, and continue halving the smallest slice each time, you can do the halving 53 times before the slice is too small for even its high-precision abilities. At that point, you can no longer halve that very thin slice, but must either include or exclude it as is. Now, how would you piece all the slices in such a way that would add up to one-tenth (0.1) or one-fifth (0.2) of a pizza? Really think about it, and try working it out. You can even try to use a real pizza, if you have a mythical precision pizza cutter at hand. :-) Most experienced programmers, of course, know the real answer, which is that there is no way to piece together an exact tenth or fifth of the pizza using those slices, no matter how finely you slice them. You can do a pretty good approximation, and if you add up the approximation of 0.1 with the approximation of 0.2, you get a pretty good approximation of 0.3, but it's still just that, an approximation. For double-precision numbers (which is the precision that allows you to halve your pizza 53 times), the numbers immediately less and greater than 0.1 are 0.09999999999999999167332731531132594682276248931884765625 and 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625. The latter is quite a bit closer to 0.1 than the former, so a numeric parser will, given an input of 0.1, favour the latter. (The difference between those two numbers is the \"smallest slice\" that we must decide to either include, which introduces an upward bias, or exclude, which introduces a downward bias. The technical term for that smallest slice is an ulp.) In the case of 0.2, the numbers are all the same, just scaled up by a factor of 2. Again, we favour the value that's slightly higher than 0.2. Notice that in both cases, the approximations for 0.1 and 0.2 have a slight upward bias. If we add enough of these biases in, they will push the number further and further away from what we want, and in fact, in the case of 0.1 + 0.2, the bias is high enough that the resulting number is no longer the closest number to 0.3. In particular, 0.1 + 0.2 is really 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625 + 0.200000000000000011102230246251565404236316680908203125 = 0.3000000000000000444089209850062616169452667236328125, whereas the number closest to 0.3 is actually 0.299999999999999988897769753748434595763683319091796875. P.S. Some programming languages also provide pizza cutters that can split slices into exact tenths. Although such pizza cutters are uncommon, if you do have access to one, you should use it when it's important to be able to get exactly one-tenth or one-fifth of a slice. (Originally posted on Quora.) Floating point rounding errors. 0.1 cannot be represented as accurately in base-2 as in base-10 due to the missing prime factor of 5. Just as 1/3 takes an infinite number of digits to represent in decimal, but is \"0.1\" in base-3, 0.1 takes an infinite number of digits in base-2 where it does not in base-10. And computers don't have an infinite amount of memory. In addition to the other correct answers, you may want to consider scaling your values to avoid problems with floating-point arithmetic. For example: ... instead of: The expression 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3 returns false in JavaScript, but fortunately integer arithmetic in floating-point is exact, so decimal representation errors can be avoided by scaling. As a practical example, to avoid floating-point problems where accuracy is paramount, it is recommended1 to handle money as an integer representing the number of cents: 2550 cents instead of 25.50 dollars. 1 Douglas Crockford: JavaScript: The Good Parts: Appendix A - Awful Parts (page 105). My answer is quite long, so I've split it into three sections. Since the question is about floating point mathematics, I've put the emphasis on what the machine actually does. I've also made it specific to double (64 bit) precision, but the argument applies equally to any floating point arithmetic. Preamble An IEEE 754 double-precision binary floating-point format (binary64) number represents a number of the form value = (-1)^s * (1.m51m50...m2m1m0)2 * 2e-1023 in 64 bits: 1 - IEEE 754 allows for the concept of a signed zero - +0 and -0 are treated differently: 1 / (+0) is positive infinity; 1 / (-0) is negative infinity. For zero values, the mantissa and exponent bits are all zero. Note: zero values (+0 and -0) are explicitly not classed as denormal2. 2 - This is not the case for denormal numbers, which have an offset exponent of zero (and an implied 0.). The range of denormal double precision numbers is dmin \u2264 |x| \u2264 dmax, where dmin (the smallest representable nonzero number) is 2-1023 - 51 (\u2248 4.94 * 10-324) and dmax (the largest denormal number, for which the mantissa consists entirely of 1s) is 2-1023 + 1 - 2-1023 - 51 (\u2248 2.225 * 10-308). Turning a double precision number to binary Many online converters exist to convert a double precision floating point number to binary (e.g. at binaryconvert.com), but here is some sample C# code to obtain the IEEE 754 representation for a double precision number (I separate the three parts with colons (:): Getting to the point: the original question (Skip to the bottom for the TL;DR version) Cato Johnston (the question asker) asked why 0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3. Written in binary (with colons separating the three parts), the IEEE 754 representations of the values are: Note that the mantissa is composed of recurring digits of 0011. This is key to why there is any error to the calculations - 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 cannot be represented in binary precisely in a finite number of binary bits any more than 1/9, 1/3 or 1/7 can be represented precisely in decimal digits. Also note that we can decrease the power in the exponent by 52 and shift the point in the binary representation to the right by 52 places (much like 10-3 * 1.23 == 10-5 * 123). This then enables us to represent the binary representation as the exact value that it represents in the form a * 2p. where 'a' is an integer. Converting the exponents to decimal, removing the offset, and re-adding the implied 1 (in square brackets), 0.1 and 0.2 are: To add two numbers, the exponent needs to be the same, i.e.: Since the sum is not of the form 2n * 1.{bbb} we increase the exponent by one and shift the decimal (binary) point to get: There are now 53 bits in the mantissa (the 53rd is in square brackets in the line above). The default rounding mode for IEEE 754 is 'Round to Nearest' - i.e. if a number x falls between two values a and b, the value where the least significant bit is zero is chosen. Note that a and b differ only in the last bit; ...0011 + 1 = ...0100. In this case, the value with the least significant bit of zero is b, so the sum is: whereas the binary representation of 0.3 is: which only differs from the binary representation of the sum of 0.1 and 0.2 by 2-54. The binary representation of 0.1 and 0.2 are the most accurate representations of the numbers allowable by IEEE 754. The addition of these representation, due to the default rounding mode, results in a value which differs only in the least-significant-bit. TL;DR Writing 0.1 + 0.2 in a IEEE 754 binary representation (with colons separating the three parts) and comparing it to 0.3, this is (I've put the distinct bits in square brackets): Converted back to decimal, these values are: The difference is exactly 2-54, which is ~5.5511151231258 \u00d7 10-17 - insignificant (for many applications) when compared to the original values. Comparing the last few bits of a floating point number is inherently dangerous, as anyone who reads the famous \"What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic\" (which covers all the major parts of this answer) will know. Most calculators use additional guard digits to get around this problem, which is how 0.1 + 0.2 would give 0.3: the final few bits are rounded. Floating point numbers stored in the computer consist of two parts, an integer and an exponent that the base is taken to and multiplied by the integer part. If the computer were working in base 10, 0.1 would be 1 x 10\u207b\u00b9, 0.2 would be 2 x 10\u207b\u00b9, and 0.3 would be 3 x 10\u207b\u00b9. Integer math is easy and exact, so adding 0.1 + 0.2 will obviously result in 0.3. Computers don't usually work in base 10, they work in base 2. You can still get exact results for some values, for example 0.5 is 1 x 2\u207b\u00b9 and 0.25 is 1 x 2\u207b\u00b2, and adding them results in 3 x 2\u207b\u00b2, or 0.75. Exactly. The problem comes with numbers that can be represented exactly in base 10, but not in base 2. Those numbers need to be rounded to their closest equivalent. Assuming the very common IEEE 64-bit floating point format, the closest number to 0.1 is 3602879701896397 x 2\u207b\u2075\u2075, and the closest number to 0.2 is 7205759403792794 x 2\u207b\u2075\u2075; adding them together results in 10808639105689191 x 2\u207b\u2075\u2075, or an exact decimal value of 0.3000000000000000444089209850062616169452667236328125. Floating point numbers are generally rounded for display. Floating point rounding error.  From What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic: Squeezing infinitely many real numbers into a finite number of bits requires an approximate representation. Although there are infinitely many integers, in most programs the result of integer computations can be stored in 32 bits. In contrast, given any fixed number of bits, most calculations with real numbers will produce quantities that cannot be exactly represented using that many bits. Therefore the result of a floating-point calculation must often be rounded in order to fit back into its finite representation. This rounding error is the characteristic feature of floating-point computation. In short it's because: Floating point numbers cannot represent all decimals precisely in binary So just like 10/3 which does not exist in base 10 precisely (it will be 3.33... recurring), in the same way 1/10 doesn't exist in binary. So what? How to deal with it? Is there any workaround? In order to offer The best solution I can say I discovered following method: Let me explain why it's the best solution. As others mentioned in above answers it's a good idea to use ready to use Javascript toFixed() function to solve the problem. But most likely you'll encounter with some problems. Imagine you are going to add up two float numbers like 0.2 and 0.7 here it is: 0.2 + 0.7 = 0.8999999999999999. Your expected result was 0.9 it means you need a result with 1 digit precision in this case. So you should have used (0.2 + 0.7).tofixed(1) but you can't just give a certain parameter to toFixed() since it depends on the given number, for instance In this example you need 2 digits precision so it should be toFixed(2), so what should be the paramter to fit every given float number? You might say let it be 10 in every situation then: Damn! What are you going to do with those unwanted zeros after 9? It's the time to convert it to float to make it as you desire: Now that you found the solution, it's better to offer it as a function like this: Let's try it yourself: You can use it this way: As W3SCHOOLS suggests there is another solution too, you can multiply and divide to solve the problem above: Keep in mind that (0.2 + 0.1) * 10 / 10 won't work at all although it seems the same! I prefer the first solution since I can apply it as a function which converts the input float to accurate output float. My workaround: precision refers to the number of digits you want to preserve after the decimal point during addition. A lot of good answers have been posted, but I'd like to append one more. Not all numbers can be represented via floats/doubles For example, the number \"0.2\" will be represented as \"0.200000003\" in single precision in IEEE754 float point standard. Model for store real numbers under the hood represent float numbers as  Even though you can type 0.2 easily, FLT_RADIX and DBL_RADIX is 2; not 10 for a computer with FPU which uses \"IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic (ISO/IEEE Std 754-1985)\". So it is a bit hard to represent such numbers exactly. Even if you specify this variable explicitly without any intermediate calculation. Summary Floating point arithmetic is exact, unfortunately, it doesn't match up well with our usual base-10 number representation, so it turns out we are often giving it input that is slightly off from what we wrote. Even simple numbers like 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04 ... 0.24 are not representable exactly as binary fractions. If you count up 0.01, .02, .03 ..., not until you get to 0.25 will you get the first fraction representable in base2.  If you tried that using FP, your 0.01 would have been slightly off, so the only way to add 25 of them up to a nice exact 0.25 would have required a long chain of causality involving guard bits and rounding. It's hard to predict so we throw up our hands and say \"FP is inexact\", but that's not really true. We constantly give the FP hardware something that seems simple in base 10 but is a repeating fraction in base 2. How did this happen? When we write in decimal, every fraction (specifically, every terminating decimal) is a rational number of the form a / (2n x 5m) In binary, we only get the 2n term, that is: a / 2n So in decimal, we can't represent 1/3. Because base 10 includes 2 as a prime factor, every number we can write as a binary fraction also can be written as a base 10 fraction. However, hardly anything we write as a base10 fraction is representable in binary. In the range from 0.01, 0.02, 0.03 ... 0.99, only three numbers can be represented in our FP format: 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75, because they are 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4, all numbers with a prime factor using only the 2n term. In base10 we can't represent 1/3. But in binary, we can't do 1/10 or 1/3. So while every binary fraction can be written in decimal, the reverse is not true. And in fact most decimal fractions repeat in binary. Dealing with it Developers are usually instructed to do < epsilon comparisons, better advice might be to round to integral values (in the C library: round() and roundf(), i.e., stay in the FP format) and then compare. Rounding to a specific decimal fraction length solves most problems with output. Also, on real number-crunching problems (the problems that FP was invented for on early, frightfully expensive computers) the physical constants of the universe and all other measurements are only known to a relatively small number of significant figures, so the entire problem space was \"inexact\" anyway. FP \"accuracy\" isn't a problem in this kind of application. The whole issue really arises when people try to use FP for bean counting. It does work for that, but only if you stick to integral values, which kind of defeats the point of using it. This is why we have all those decimal fraction software libraries. I love the Pizza answer by Chris, because it describes the actual problem, not just the usual handwaving about \"inaccuracy\". If FP were simply \"inaccurate\", we could fix that and would have done it decades ago. The reason we haven't is because the FP format is compact and fast and it's the best way to crunch a lot of numbers. Also, it's a legacy from the space age and arms race and early attempts to solve big problems with very slow computers using small memory systems. (Sometimes, individual magnetic cores for 1-bit storage, but that's another story.) Conclusion If you are just counting beans at a bank, software solutions that use decimal string representations in the first place work perfectly well. But you can't do quantum chromodynamics or aerodynamics that way. Some statistics related to this famous double precision question. When adding all values (a + b) using a step of 0.1 (from 0.1 to 100) we have ~15% chance of precision error. Note that the error could result in slightly bigger or smaller values. Here are some examples: When subtracting all values (a - b where a > b) using a step of 0.1 (from 100 to 0.1) we have ~34% chance of precision error. Here are some examples: *15% and 34% are indeed huge, so always use BigDecimal when precision is of big importance. With 2 decimal digits (step 0.01) the situation worsens a bit more (18% and 36%). Did you try the duct tape solution? Try to determine when errors occur and fix them with short if statements, it's not pretty but for some problems it is the only solution and this is one of them. I had the same problem in a scientific simulation project in c#, and I can tell you that if you ignore the butterfly effect it's gonna turn to a big fat dragon and bite you in the a** Given that nobody has mentioned this... Some high level languages such as Python and Java come with tools to overcome binary floating point limitations. For example: Python's decimal module and Java's BigDecimal class, that represent numbers internally with decimal notation (as opposed to binary notation). Both have limited precision, so they are still error prone, however they solve most common problems with binary floating point arithmetic. Decimals are very nice when dealing with money: ten cents plus twenty cents are always exactly thirty cents: Python's decimal module is based on IEEE standard 854-1987. Python's fractions module and Apache Common's BigFraction class. Both represent rational numbers as (numerator, denominator) pairs and they may give more accurate results than decimal floating point arithmetic. Neither of these solutions is perfect (especially if we look at performances, or if we require a very high precision), but still they solve a great number of problems with binary floating point arithmetic. Those weird numbers appear because computers use binary(base 2) number system for calculation purposes, while we use decimal(base 10). There are a majority of fractional numbers that cannot be represented precisely either in binary or in decimal or both. Result - A rounded up (but precise) number results. Many of this question's numerous duplicates ask about the effects of floating point rounding on specific numbers. In practice, it is easier to get a feeling for how it works by looking at exact results of calculations of interest rather than by just reading about it. Some languages provide ways of doing that - such as converting a float or double to BigDecimal in Java. Since this is a language-agnostic question, it needs language-agnostic tools, such as a Decimal to Floating-Point Converter. Applying it to the numbers in the question, treated as doubles: 0.1 converts to 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625, 0.2 converts to 0.200000000000000011102230246251565404236316680908203125, 0.3 converts to 0.299999999999999988897769753748434595763683319091796875, and 0.30000000000000004 converts to 0.3000000000000000444089209850062616169452667236328125. Adding the first two numbers manually or in a decimal calculator such as Full Precision Calculator, shows the exact sum of the actual inputs is 0.3000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875. If it were rounded down to the equivalent of 0.3 the rounding error would be 0.0000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125. Rounding up to the equivalent of 0.30000000000000004 also gives rounding error 0.0000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125. The round-to-even tie breaker applies. Returning to the floating point converter, the raw hexadecimal for 0.30000000000000004 is 3fd3333333333334, which ends in an even digit and therefore is the correct result. Can I just add; people always assume this to be a computer problem, but if you count with your hands (base 10), you can't get (1/3+1/3=2/3)=true unless you have infinity to add 0.333... to 0.333... so just as with the (1/10+2/10)!==3/10 problem in base 2, you truncate it to 0.333 + 0.333 = 0.666 and probably round it to 0.667 which would be also be technically inaccurate. Count in ternary, and thirds are not a problem though - maybe some race with 15 fingers on each hand would ask why your decimal math was broken... The kind of floating-point math that can be implemented in a digital computer necessarily uses an approximation of the real numbers and operations on them. (The standard version runs to over fifty pages of documentation and has a committee to deal with its errata and further refinement.) This approximation is a mixture of approximations of different kinds, each of which can either be ignored or carefully accounted for due to its specific manner of deviation from exactitude. It also involves a number of explicit exceptional cases at both the hardware and software levels that most people walk right past while pretending not to notice. If you need infinite precision (using the number \u03c0, for example, instead of one of its many shorter stand-ins), you should write or use a symbolic math program instead. But if you're okay with the idea that sometimes floating-point math is fuzzy in value and logic and errors can accumulate quickly, and you can write your requirements and tests to allow for that, then your code can frequently get by with what's in your FPU. Just for fun, I played with the representation of floats, following the definitions from the Standard C99 and I wrote the code below. The code prints the binary representation of floats in 3 separated groups and after that it prints a sum, that, when summed with enough precision, it will show the value that really exists in hardware. So when you write float x = 999..., the compiler will transform that number in a bit representation printed by the function xx such that the sum printed by the function yy be equal to the given number. In reality, this sum is only an approximation.  For the number 999,999,999  the compiler will insert in bit representation of the float the number 1,000,000,000 After the code I attach a console session, in which I compute the sum of terms for both constants (minus PI and 999999999) that really exists in hardware, inserted there by the compiler. Here is a console session in which I compute the real value of the float that exists in hardware.  I used bc to print the sum of terms outputted by the main program.  One can insert that sum in python repl or something similar also. That's it.  The value of 999999999 is in fact You can also check with bc that -3.14 is also perturbed.  Do not forget to set a scale factor in bc. The displayed sum is what inside the hardware.  The value you obtain by computing it depends on the scale you set.  I did set the scale factor to 15.  Mathematically, with infinite precision, it seems it is 1,000,000,000. Another way to look at this: Used are 64 bits to represent numbers. As consequence there is no way more than 2**64 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 different numbers can be precisely represented. However, Math says there are already infinitely many decimals between 0 and 1. IEE 754 defines an encoding to use these 64 bits efficiently for a much larger number space plus NaN and +/- Infinity, so there are gaps between accurately represented numbers filled with numbers only approximated. Unfortunately 0.3 sits in a gap. Since Python 3.5 you can use math.isclose() function for testing approximate equality: Floating point numbers are represented, at the hardware level, as fractions of binary numbers (base 2). For example, the decimal fraction: has the value 1/10 + 2/100 + 5/1000 and, in the same way, the binary fraction: has the value 0/2 + 0/4 + 1/8. These two fractions have the same value, the only difference is that the first is a decimal fraction, the second is a binary fraction. Unfortunately, most decimal fractions cannot have exact representation in binary fractions. Therefore, in general, the floating point numbers you give are only approximated to binary fractions to be stored in the machine. The problem is easier to approach in base 10. Take for example, the fraction 1/3. You can approximate it to a decimal fraction: or better, or better, etc. No matter how many decimal places you write, the result is never exactly 1/3, but it is an estimate that always comes closer. Likewise, no matter how many base 2 decimal places you use, the decimal value 0.1 cannot be represented exactly as a binary fraction. In base 2, 1/10 is the following periodic number: Stop at any finite amount of bits, and you'll get an approximation. For Python, on a typical machine, 53 bits are used for the precision of a float, so the value stored when you enter the decimal 0.1 is the binary fraction. which is close, but not exactly equal, to 1/10. It's easy to forget that the stored value is an approximation of the original decimal fraction, due to the way floats are displayed in the interpreter. Python only displays a decimal approximation of the value stored in binary. If Python were to output the true decimal value of the binary approximation stored for 0.1, it would output: This is a lot more decimal places than most people would expect, so Python displays a rounded value to improve readability: It is important to understand that in reality this is an illusion: the stored value is not exactly 1/10, it is simply on the display that the stored value is rounded. This becomes evident as soon as you perform arithmetic operations with these values: This behavior is inherent to the very nature of the machine's floating-point representation: it is not a bug in Python, nor is it a bug in your code. You can observe the same type of behavior in all other languages \u200b\u200bthat use hardware support for calculating floating point numbers (although some languages \u200b\u200bdo not make the difference visible by default, or not in all display modes). Another surprise is inherent in this one. For example, if you try to round the value 2.675 to two decimal places, you will get The documentation for the round() primitive indicates that it rounds to the nearest value away from zero. Since the decimal fraction is exactly halfway between 2.67 and 2.68, you should expect to get (a binary approximation of) 2.68. This is not the case, however, because when the decimal fraction 2.675 is converted to a float, it is stored by an approximation whose exact value is : Since the approximation is slightly closer to 2.67 than 2.68, the rounding is down. If you are in a situation where rounding decimal numbers halfway down matters, you should use the decimal module. By the way, the decimal module also provides a convenient way to \"see\" the exact value stored for any float. Another consequence of the fact that 0.1 is not exactly stored in 1/10 is that the sum of ten values \u200b\u200bof 0.1 does not give 1.0 either: The arithmetic of binary floating point numbers holds many such surprises. The problem with \"0.1\" is explained in detail below, in the section \"Representation errors\". See The Perils of Floating Point for a more complete list of such surprises. It is true that there is no simple answer, however do not be overly suspicious of floating virtula numbers! Errors, in Python, in floating-point number operations are due to the underlying hardware, and on most machines are no more than 1 in 2 ** 53 per operation. This is more than necessary for most tasks, but you should keep in mind that these are not decimal operations, and every operation on floating point numbers may suffer from a new error. Although pathological cases exist, for most common use cases you will get the expected result at the end by simply rounding up to the number of decimal places you want on the display. For fine control over how floats are displayed, see String Formatting Syntax for the formatting specifications of the str.format () method. This part of the answer explains in detail the example of \"0.1\" and shows how you can perform an exact analysis of this type of case on your own. We assume that you are familiar with the binary representation of floating point numbers.The term Representation error means that most decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly in binary. This is the main reason why Python (or Perl, C, C ++, Java, Fortran, and many others) usually doesn't display the exact result in decimal: Why ? 1/10 and 2/10 are not representable exactly in binary fractions. However, all machines today (July 2010) follow the IEEE-754 standard for the arithmetic of floating point numbers. and most platforms use an \"IEEE-754 double precision\" to represent Python floats. Double precision IEEE-754 uses 53 bits of precision, so on reading the computer tries to convert 0.1 to the nearest fraction of the form J / 2 ** N with J an integer of exactly 53 bits. Rewrite : in : remembering that J is exactly 53 bits (so> = 2 ** 52 but <2 ** 53), the best possible value for N is 56: So 56 is the only possible value for N which leaves exactly 53 bits for J. The best possible value for J is therefore this quotient, rounded: Since the carry is greater than half of 10, the best approximation is obtained by rounding up: Therefore the best possible approximation for 1/10 in \"IEEE-754 double precision\" is this above 2 ** 56, that is: Note that since the rounding was done upward, the result is actually slightly greater than 1/10; if we hadn't rounded up, the quotient would have been slightly less than 1/10. But in no case is it exactly 1/10! So the computer never \"sees\" 1/10: what it sees is the exact fraction given above, the best approximation using the double precision floating point numbers from the \"\" IEEE-754 \": If we multiply this fraction by 10 ** 30, we can observe the values \u200b\u200bof its 30 decimal places of strong weight. meaning that the exact value stored in the computer is approximately equal to the decimal value 0.100000000000000005551115123125. In versions prior to Python 2.7 and Python 3.1, Python rounded these values \u200b\u200bto 17 significant decimal places, displaying \u201c0.10000000000000001\u201d. In current versions of Python, the displayed value is the value whose fraction is as short as possible while giving exactly the same representation when converted back to binary, simply displaying \u201c0.1\u201d. Imagine working in base ten with, say, 8 digits of accuracy.  You check whether and learn that this returns false.  Why?  Well, as real numbers we have 1/3 = 0.333.... and 2/3 = 0.666.... Truncating at eight decimal places, we get which is, of course, different from 1.00000000 by exactly 0.00000001. The situation for binary numbers with a fixed number of bits is exactly analogous. As real numbers, we have 1/10 = 0.0001100110011001100... (base 2) and 1/5 = 0.0011001100110011001... (base 2) If we truncated these to, say, seven bits, then we'd get while on the other hand, 3/10 = 0.01001100110011... (base 2) which, truncated to seven bits, is 0.0100110, and these differ by exactly 0.0000001. The exact situation is slightly more subtle because these numbers are typically stored in scientific notation.  So, for instance, instead of storing 1/10 as 0.0001100 we may store it as something like 1.10011 * 2^-4, depending on how many bits we've allocated for the exponent and the mantissa.  This affects how many digits of precision you get for your calculations. The upshot is that because of these rounding errors you essentially never want to use == on floating-point numbers.  Instead, you can check if the absolute value of their difference is smaller than some fixed small number. Decimal numbers such as 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 are not represented exactly in binary encoded floating point types. The sum of the approximations for 0.1 and 0.2 differs from the approximation used for 0.3, hence the falsehood of 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3 as can be seen more clearly here: Output: For these computations to be evaluated more reliably, you would need to use a decimal-based representation for floating point values. The C Standard does not specify such types by default but as an extension described in a technical Report. The _Decimal32, _Decimal64 and _Decimal128 types might be available on your system (for example, GCC supports them on selected targets, but Clang does not support them on OS\u00a0X). Since this thread branched off a bit into a general discussion over current floating point implementations I'd add that there are projects on fixing their issues. Take a look at https://posithub.org/ for example, which showcases a number type called posit (and its predecessor unum) that promises to offer better accuracy with fewer bits. If my understanding is correct, it also fixes the kind of problems in the question. Quite interesting project, the person behind it is a mathematician it Dr. John Gustafson. The whole thing is open source, with many actual implementations in C/C++, Python, Julia and C# (https://hastlayer.com/arithmetics). It's actually pretty simple. When you have a base 10 system (like ours), it can only express fractions that use a prime factor of the base. The prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5. So 1/2, 1/4, 1/5, 1/8, and 1/10 can all be expressed cleanly because the denominators all use prime factors of 10. In contrast, 1/3, 1/6, and 1/7 are all repeating decimals because their denominators use a prime factor of 3 or 7. In binary (or base 2), the only prime factor is 2. So you can only express fractions cleanly which only contain 2 as a prime factor. In binary, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 would all be expressed cleanly as decimals. While, 1/5 or 1/10 would be repeating decimals. So 0.1 and 0.2 (1/10 and 1/5) while clean decimals in a base 10 system, are repeating decimals in the base 2 system the computer is operating in. When you do math on these repeating decimals, you end up with leftovers which carry over when you convert the computer's base 2 (binary) number into a more human readable base 10 number. From https://0.30000000000000004.com/ The trap with floating point numbers is that they look like decimal but they work in binary. The only prime factor of 2 is 2, while 10 has prime factors of 2 and 5. The result of this is that every number that can be written exactly as a binary fraction can also be written exactly as a decimal fraction but only a subset of numbers that can be written as decimal fractions can be written as binary fractions. A floating point number is essentially a binary fraction with a limited number of significant digits. If you go past those significant digits then the results will be rounded. When you type a literal in your code or call the function to parse a floating point number to a string, it expects a decimal number and it stores a binary approximation of that decimal number in the variable. When you print a floating point number or call the function to convert one to a string it prints a decimal approximation of the floating point number. It is possible to convert a binary number to decimal exactly, but no language i'm aware of does that by default. Some languages use a fixed number of significant digits, others use the shortest string that will \"round trip\" back to the same floating point value. Consider the following results: We can clearly see a breakpoint when 2**53+1 - all works fine until 2**53.  This happens because of the double-precision binary: IEEE 754 double-precision binary floating-point format: binary64 From the Wikipedia page for Double-precision floating-point format: Double-precision binary floating-point is a commonly used format on PCs, due to its wider range over single-precision floating point, in spite of its performance and bandwidth cost. As with single-precision floating-point format, it lacks precision on integer numbers when compared with an integer format of the same size. It is commonly known simply as double. The IEEE 754 standard specifies a binary64 as having:  The real value assumed by a given 64-bit double-precision datum with a given biased exponent and a 52-bit fraction is  or  Thanks to @a_guest for pointing that out to me. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1391": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69551119/what-does-author-and-committer-mean-when-querying-commit-data-with-the-githu", "What does \"author\" and \"committer\" mean when querying commit data with the GitHub API? [duplicate] I just came across the following commit on GitHub: https://github.com/felixge/node-formidable/commit/0a0b150668daa3c6f01626d2565b898e5da12392 How does one go about having multiple authors on the same commit like that? That's not really two authors - that's an author and a committer. The two fields have different meanings. The author is the one who created the content, and the committer is the one who committed it. When you do a normal commit, you are both. (And both come with an associated email and timestamp.) But they can become different in a few key ways: git format-patch / git am - this pair lets you turn commits into patches, generally submitted by email, then have someone else apply them. You remain the author; the person who applies them is the committer. This is pretty definitely what happened on github there. git commit --amend, git rebase, git filter-branch - These are all basically variants on history rewriting, ranging from single commit to some history of a branch to the entire history. They can potentially modify the committer information - in particular, they always rewrite the committer timestamp. The original author remains in place (in default  modes of operation), and if the author is also the one doing the rewriting, their name and email stay, but the timestamp is naturally different. There aren't multiple authors associated with that commit (nor is it currently possible to assign multiple authors to a single commit). In this case, gliese1337 was the author, and felixge was the committer. Most likely, this occurred because gliese1337 submitted a pull request which was accepted and then committed by felixhe (the repository owner). That workflow's pretty common on GitHub. This is also helpful for instances when a project maintainer receives a patch via email, so the author of the patch itself still receives credit for the patch, even if he or she doesn't have commit access to the project. A couple of related links: Short Git Wiki section on author attribution A feature request for multiple author functionality in Git core It is not multiple authors. One is the author and another is commiter. If you'd make a clone you could see it clearly: Git web interface like GitHub and GitLab In such systems, when merging a patch the author may or may not be different from the committer depending on the repo settings. Since Git(Hub|Lab) hold both the upstream and the fork repositories on a the same machine, it can do automatically do anything that you can do locally as well: Create a merge commit. Does not generate author != committer. Keeps the SHA or the new commit intact, and creates a new commit: Historically, this was the first available method on GitHub. Locally, this is done with git merge --no-ff. This produces two commits per pull request, and keeps a fork in the git history. rebase on top of master While this is not mandatory in principle, and not even done by default locally by git rebase, GitHub also hacks the commits to set committer == whoever pressed the merge button. The reason for doing this, is that it gives accountability to the project maintainer. The git tree now looks like: which is exactly like that of the git apply email patches. On GitHub currently: https://help.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/ In short, when you do a Pull Request to a gihub/gitlab/etc hosted repo and is accepted by the repo's maintainer, you are the author, he/she is the commiter. And when you git cloned this repo, use git cat-file -p xxx_hash will display author & commiter message. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1392": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69551117/problem-to-handling-404-htaccess-with-custom-rules", "Problem to handling 404 htaccess with custom rules I am getting trouble to redirect error 404's to my homepage, I am using the normal rule ErrorDocument 404 but it is not redirecting when I request an invalid URL like (/notexist/) the only thing the server do is display a message \"File not found.\" I am using apache server and below is the content of my .htaccess: Here is the print of the request and the message: I need to every error 404 automatically gets redirect to my homepage, could someone give me a hand, please? site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1393": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69551116/error-767-unexpected-token-at-when-install-node-in-macos", "Error: 767: unexpected token at '{ when install node in macOS when I am install node in macOS Catalina using this command: shows this error: what should I do to fix this problem? site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1394": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69551114/snapchat-share-with-ionic-capacitor", "Snapchat share with Ionic capacitor I am trying to integrate the snapchat creative kit with Ionic & capacitor.

If you want to do it just to learn MySQLi then you should keep these things in mind: This is how you open the connection properly: There is no bind-in-execute in MySQLi. In fact there is no bind by value at all! You can only bind by reference and you have to specify the type of the value. MySQLi has no named placeholders, so you need to use positional ones only. The fetch method in MySQLi works totally differently and it returns boolean. To get the same outcome as PDO's fetch() you would need to get_result() and then use fetch_array() or fetch_assoc() site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1414": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69551071/synchronizing-multiple-rtsp-streams-with-cudacodec-videoreader", "Synchronizing multiple RTSP streams with Cudacodec VideoReader?

This is our structure: As is the case with requirements.txt, I naively though that something as follow would work out: It doesn't work. An alternative is to add the submodule in packages and indicate its directory in package_dir. Well it didn't work that well, and what's the point of making a setup.py in the \"submodule\" if it can't be installed when installing the dependent module?

I have been trying to use method chaining in Pandas however there are a few things related to how you reference a DataFrame or its columns that keep tripping me up. For example in the code below I have filtered the dataset and then want to create a new column that sums the columns remaining after the filter. However I don't know how to reference the DataFrame that has just been created from the filter. df in the example below refers to the original DataFrame. Or what about this instance, where the DataFrame is being created in the method chain, This would normally be a pd.read_csv step as opposed to generating the DataFrame. This piece of code would naturally not work as df2 has not been created as yet. Interestingly enough the issue above is not a problem here as df3['xx'] refers to the df3 that has been queried which makes some sense in the context of the second example but then does not make sense with the first example. I have worked in other languages/libraries such as R or PySpark and method chaining is quite flexible and does not appear to have these barriers. Unless there is something I am missing on how its meant to be done in Pandas or how you meant to reference df['xx'] in some other manner. Lastly I understand that the example problems are easily worked around but I am trying to understand if there is a set method chaining syntax that I am maybe not aware of when referencing these columns. For referencing the DataFrame based on a previous computation, the anonymous function(lambda helps) : It basically references the previous DataFrame. This works with assign. The pipe method is another option where you can chain methods while referencing the computed DataFrame. The example below is superflous; hopefully it explains how pipe works: Not all Pandas functions support chaining; this is where the pipe function could come in handy; you could even write custom functions and pass it to pipe.

Error: No version found in the artifact repository that satisfies the requested version '' for VM extension with publisher 'Microsoft.WindowsAzure.GuestAgent' and type 'CRPProd' Working again: Summary of impact: Between 05:12 UTC and 11:45 UTC on 13 Oct 2021, a subset of customers using Windows Virtual Machines may have received failure notifications when performing service management operations - such as start, create, update, delete. Deployments of new VMs and any updates to extensions may have failed. Non-Windows Virtual Machines, and existing running Windows Virtual Machines should not have been impacted by this issue. Additionally, services with dependencies on Windows VMs may have also experienced similar failures when creating resources. Preliminary root cause: We identified that calls made during service management operations were failing as a required artifact version data could not be queried. Our investigation focused on the backend compute resource provider (CRP) to determine why the calls were failing, and identified that a required VMGuestAgent could not be queried from the repository. The VM Guest Agent Extension publishing architecture was being migrated (as part of RDFE migration) to a new platform which leverages the latest Azure Resource Manager (ARM) capabilities Mitigation: We mitigated impact by marking the appropriate extensions to the correct expected level (in this case, public).

I think you want something like Remove-Item (Join-Path $Path  $File.Name) I have been able to reproduce the issue only when the path $Path contains just one child item. In that case, Powershell thinks you are trying to add a string to a DirectoryInfo or FileInfo, hence the error. If $Temp contains more elements, it just creates a new array containing all the elements in $Original and also containing $File.Name. This is because Powershell does not know wheter or not a function (Get-ChildItem in this case) can output more than one element. Because it is an scripting environment, it will treat the output of a function as scalar if the function ouputs just one element. You can force it to use an array by using @(...).

Is that possible with projections? Or is a projection always only readonly? https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#projections Short answer, no, you cannot use Spring Data projections for updates. What you could do instead if you don't want to fetch the entity beforehand is to write custom queries to update certain fields. You can do the update with JPQL or Native Queries as well. I quote the following sources to answer your question: From this : SQL SELECT corresponds to the \"projection\" in relational algebra And this : The Relational Algebra was introduced by E. F. Codd in 1972. It consists of a set of operations on relations: PROJECT (\u03c0): extracts specified attributes (columns) from a relation.

[duplicate] Is it possible to skip a couple of characters in a capture group in regular expressions? I am using .NET regexes but that shouldn't matter. Basically, what I am looking for is: [random text]AB-123[random text] and I need to capture 'AB123', without the hyphen. I know that AB is 2 or 3 uppercase characters and 123 is 2 or 3 digits, but that's not the hard part. The hard part (at least for me) is skipping the hyphen. I guess I could capture both separately and then concatenate them in code, but I wish I had a more elegant, regex-only solution. Any suggestions? In short: You can't. A match is always consecutive, even when it contains things as zero-width assertions there is no way around matching the next character if you want to get to the one after it. There really isn't a way to create an expression such that the matched text is different than what is found in the source text.  You will need to remove the hyphen in a separate step either by matching the first and second parts individually and concatenating the two groups: Or by removing the hyphen in a step separate from the matching process: Your assertion that its not possible to do without sub-grouping + concatentating it is correct. You could also do as Jeff-Hillman and merely strip out the bad character(s) after the fact. Important to note here tho, is you \"dont use regex for everything\". Regex is designed for less complicated solutions for non-trivial problems, and you shouldn't use \"oh, we'll use a regex\" for everything, and you shoudn't get into the habbit of thinking you can solve the problem in a one-step regex. When there is a viable trivial method that works, by all means, use it. An alternative Idea, if you happen to be needing to return multiple matches in a body of code is look for your languages \"callback\" based regex, which permits passing any matched/found group to a function call which can do in-line substitution. ( Especially handy in doing regexp replaces ). Not sure how it would work in .Net, but in php you would do something like ( not exact code ) You can use nested capture groups, like this: The first capture group is AB-123, the second is AB, and the third is 123.  Then all you would have to do is join the second and third group with a space. Kind of late, but I think I figured this one out. At least one way to do it. I used positive lookahead to stop at the # sign in my text.  I didn't want the space or the # sign, so I had to figure a way out to \"skip\" over them.  So when I was forced to match them again, I dumped them into a garbage group that I didn't plan on using (.ie, a bit bucket) which in the code is .  Now, my place pointer is one character position beyond the # sign (where I want to be, skipping the space and the # sign).  And I now just match to the end of the file name at the . and ignore the file extension. The Filename this was used on is I am kind of new to this, but you could use the vertical bar symbol |, which acts as an OR.

[closed] Want to improve this question? Update the question so it can be answered with facts and citations by editing this post. Closed 5 hours ago. I have been googling about using Cypress for Automation API testing. I found below links: Most of the cases I can think of like Oauth, All REST Methods including Form-data, GraphQL, Assertions, mocking can be achieved using Cypress. However I was wondering why its not being used and is it a good choice over other tools? Please suggest! Thanks a lot in Advance. I currently work with Cypress only for api testing (a decision made by the company). There's no right or wrong answer. If it's the tool you want to use and you are comfortable with it, then go for it. That being said, take into account that Cypress is a framework designed to do end to end or even component testing and therefore, even when you do not have a UI, it will always use the browser to perform actions (this in the long term, and depending the amount of tests, can have an impact in the run time). Lots of things are designed to interact with ui components and you need to patch/wrap your way to perform more complex stuff. I personally had some issues with nested requests, or when having to perform multiple actions with responses. Asynchrony in general (handled in a weird way by cypress in my opinion). If I could choose, I would go with a framework designed for api testing just because it will be more flexible and probably will have more tools for you to use when dealing with some of the things I mentioned above. Hope this helps and good luck! Ask these questions and you will get the answer: I've found very few frameworks that can actually do all the above.

Ajax call returns this , this is my console says [duplicate] This is intended to be a general reference question and answer covering many of the never-ending \"How do I access data in my JSON?\" questions. It is here to handle the broad basics of decoding JSON in PHP and accessing the results. I have the JSON: How do I decode this in PHP and access the resulting data? First off you have a string. JSON is not an array, an object, or a data structure. JSON is a text-based serialization format - so a fancy string, but still just a string. Decode it in PHP by using json_decode(). Therein you might find: These are the things that can be encoded in JSON. Or more accurately, these are PHP's versions of the things that can be encoded in JSON. There's nothing special about them. They are not \"JSON objects\" or \"JSON arrays.\" You've decoded the JSON - you now have basic everyday PHP types. Objects will be instances of stdClass, a built-in class which is just a generic thing that's not important here. You access the properties of one of these objects the same way you would for the public non-static properties of any other object, e.g. $object->property. You access the elements of one of these arrays the same way you would for any other array, e.g. $array[0]. Iterate over it with foreach. Glazed    Chocolate with Sprinkles    Maple Or mess about with any of the bazillion built-in array functions. The properties of objects and the elements of arrays might be more objects and/or arrays - you can simply continue to access their properties and members as usual, e.g. $object->array[0]->etc. When you do this, instead of objects you'll get associative arrays - arrays with strings for keys. Again you access the elements thereof as usual, e.g. $array['key']. When decoding a JSON object to an associative PHP array, you can iterate both keys and values using the foreach (array_expression as $key => $value) syntax, eg Prints The value of key 'foo' is 'foo value'   The value of key 'bar' is 'bar value'   The value of key 'baz' is 'baz value' Read the documentation for whatever it is you're getting the JSON from. Look at the JSON - where you see curly brackets {} expect an object, where you see square brackets [] expect an array. Hit the decoded data with a print_r(): and check the output: It'll tell you where you have objects, where you have arrays, along with the names and values of their members. If you can only get so far into it before you get lost - go that far and hit that with print_r(): Take a look at it in this handy interactive JSON explorer. Break the problem down into pieces that are easier to wrap your head around. This happens because either: If you need to change the max depth you're probably solving the wrong problem. Find out why you're getting such deeply nested data (e.g. the service you're querying that's generating the JSON has a bug) and get that to not happen. Sometimes you'll have an object property name that contains something like a hyphen - or at sign @ which can't be used in a literal identifier. Instead you can use a string literal within curly braces to address it. If you have an integer as property see: How to access object properties with names like integers? as reference. It's ridiculous but it happens - there's JSON encoded as a string within your JSON. Decode, access the string as usual, decode that, and eventually get to what you need. If your JSON is too large for json_decode() to handle at once things start to get tricky. See: See: Reference: all basic ways to sort arrays and data in PHP. You can use json_decode() to convert a json string to a PHP object/array. Eg. Input: Output: Few Points to remember: We can decode json string into array using json_decode function in php 1) json_decode($json_string) // it returns object 2) json_decode($json_string,true) // it returns array Consider using JSONPath https://packagist.org/packages/flow/jsonpath There is a pretty clear explanation of how to use it and parse a JSON-file avoiding all the loops proposed. If you are familiar with XPath for XML you will start loving this approach. The acepted Answer is very detailed and correct in most of the cases. I just want to add that i was getting an error while attempting to load a JSON text file encoded with UTF8, i had a well formatted JSON but the 'json_decode' always returned me with NULL, it was due the BOM mark. To solve it, i made this PHP function: Then i use it like this to load a JSON file and get a value from it: https://paiza.io/projects/X1QjjBkA8mDo6oVh-J_63w Check below code for converting json to array in PHP, If JSON is correct then json_decode() works well, and will return an array, But if malformed JSON, then It will return NULL, If malformed JSON, and you are expecting only array, then you can use this function, If malformed JSON, and you want to stop code execution, then you can use this function, You can use any function depends on your requirement, site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1476": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69550957/story-view-are-not-show-in-my-fragment-in-recycler-view", "Story view are not show in my fragment in recycler view I have to some problem to return data from firebase no error show but no data return from firebase realtime database.

What I should change? My intention is to have an HashMap which contains all signed up users (I saved them in a .properties file which is corrected red because I saw that), where keys are roles of users (Administrators, Employees and Customers), and the value of each key is a LinkedList of each user with that role. I also tried to use super instead of extends, but in that case I solve this error, but a new error appear in creating the hashmap with Map.of() (because Administrator, Customer and Employee aren't superclass of User). The code works if I have 3 different lists declared directly with 3 roles objects, but I wanted the hashmap because I want to return the whole signed up users divided by their role. Thanks to all, I hope I was clear in explaining. The reason for the compiler error has been covered in @Thomas's comment: To the compiler, signedUpUsers.get(\"Administrator\") is a LinkedList<? extends User>, not knowing that under the \"Administrator\" key, you stored a LinkedList<Administrator> (and not e.g. a LinkedList<Employee>, so the compiler does not allow adding an Administrator. Your signedUpUsers variable shows some significant generics over-engineering. You declare I suggest to change that to You might ask \"But now I don't have the type safety that I can only store Administrator instances under the \"Administrator\" key.\" But that type safety also wasn't possible with the first version (at run-time, the LinkedList<Administrator> is just a LinkedList and will happily accept any Object, and at compile-time LinkedList<? extends User> will not allow adding anything). If you want type safety for the lists, throw away the Map approach, and create a class UserList: This will easily give the desired type safety. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1508": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69550883/his-host-integration-server-migration-tool-issue", "HIS (Host Integration Server) Migration Tool issue I am trying to migrate HIS 2020 configuration from one server to another server.

So far it works well and without issue. However, after the user logs in I check whether a user with the ID provided by the gluu server exists in our database because I need additional information on the user. Now, this is done after the login when checking things like permissions and fetching user-specific properties like settings. If the user does not exist on our end I get a NullPointerException.

Perhaps something like: This is answered in some of the answers to Can't find how to use HttpContent as well as in this blog post. In summary, you can't directly set up an instance of HttpContent because it is an abstract class. You need to use one the classes derived from it depending on your need. Most likely StringContent, which lets you set the string value of the response, the encoding, and the media type in the constructor.

Each project has a picture associated with it. The path to this picture is saved in the database (each picture is added as models.ImageField() to the projects model). In order to serve them, I added MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'main/media') to my settings.py and added the following snippet to my urlpatternsin urls.py: + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT) Now to the crux of it: Everything works fine, except I can't open my admin panel now.

What is the problem with my code?? please help me correct it if any wrong input, codes, programs are found. Thank you. There two issues with your code. First you need to use % to get the rest of the division x / k. Second as you're doing it, you exit the function as soon as you have found a number in your list that is a multiple of k: you don't check remaining items in your list. Here is a modified version of your code: Use modulo instead of floor division. Floor division: This will gives you the quotient Modulus: This will give you the remainder. But this will not give all numbers result i.e it will print last values 3%4 False. Use %7 instead of //7. // will give you whole number quotient and % will give you remainder. Let use say some number 49, 49//7 is 7 and 49%7 is 0. Another example 26, 26//7 is 3 and 26%7 is 5 In your code the return inside the loop will quit the loop as soon as the condition will be satisfied, so, it will will not check all numbers in the list. You can use for example list comprehension and the all function from the standard library, see docs, You aren't actually checking every item of the loop. This is returning from the function after only checking the first item in the list. Also the way you are checking if one number is divisible by another isn't quite right. You should be using the modulo operator \"%\". This operator gives you the remainder after the division. Therefore your program should become: site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1557": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69550784/having-some-issue-with-vlookup", "Having some issue with vlookup I'm testing the VLOOKUP function with different sheets.

[duplicate] I'm sure this must have been mentioned/asked before but have been searching for an age with no luck, my terminology must be wrong! I vaguely remember a tweet I saw a while ago that suggested that there was a css rule available that would remove any styles previously set in the stylesheet for a particular element. A good use example might be in a mobile-first RWD site where much of the styling used for a particular element in the small-screen views needs 'resetting' or removing for the same element in the desktop view. A css rule that could achieve something like: Example usage: So we could quickly remove or re-set styling without having to declare every property. Makes sense? The CSS3 keyword initial sets the CSS3 property to the initial value as defined in the spec. The initial keyword has broad browser support except for the IE and Opera Mini families. Since IE's lack of support may cause issue here are some of the ways you can reset some CSS properties to their initial values: As mentioned in a comment by @user566245 : this is correct in principle, but individual mileage may vary. For example certain elements like textarea by default have a border, applying this reset will render those textarea's border less. JAVASCRIPT ? Nobody thought about other than css to reset css? Yes? There is that snip fully relevant : https://stackoverflow.com/a/14791113/845310 getElementsByTagName(\"*\") will return all elements from DOM. Then you may set styles for each element in the collection: answered Feb 9 '13 at 20:15 by VisioN With all this said; i don't think a css reset is something feasable unless we end up with only one web browser .. if the 'default' is set by browser in the end. For comparison, here is Firefox 40.0 values list for a <blockquote style=\"all: unset;font-style: oblique\"> where font-style: oblique triggers DOM operation. For future readers. I think this is what was meant but currently isn't really wide supported (see below): CSS: SCSS: There's a brand new solution found to this problem. Use all: revert or all: unset. From MDN: The revert keyword works exactly the same as unset in many cases. The   only difference is for properties that have values set by the browser   or by custom stylesheets created by users (set on the browser side). You need \"A css rule available that would remove any styles previously set in the stylesheet for a particular element.\" So, if the element have a class name like remove-all-styles: Eg: HTML: With CSS: Will reset all styles applied by other-class, another-class and all other inherited and applied styles to that div. Or in your case: Will do. Here we used one cool CSS property with another cool CSS value. Actually revert, as the name says, reverts that property to its   user or user-agent style. And when we use revert with the all property, all CSS properties   applied to that element will be reverted to user/user-agent styles. Click here to know difference between author, user, user-agent styles. For ex: if we want to isolate embedded widgets/components from the styles of the page that contains them, we could write: Which will reverts all author styles (ie developer CSS) to user styles (styles which a user of our website set - less likely scenario) or to user-agent styles itself if no user styles set. More details here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/revert And only issue is the support: only Safari 9.1 and iOS Safari 9.3 have support for revert value at the time of writing. So I'll say use this style and fallback to any other answers. Let me answer this question thoroughly, because it's been a source of pain for me for several years and very few people really understand the problem and why it's important for it to be solved.  If I were at all responsible for the CSS spec I'd be embarrassed, frankly, for having not addressed this in the last decade. The Problem You need to insert markup into an HTML document, and it needs to look a specific way.  Furthermore, you do not own this document, so you cannot change existing style rules.  You have no idea what the style sheets could be, or what they may change to. Use cases for this are when you are providing a displayable component for unknown 3rd party websites to use.  Examples of this would be: Simplest Fix Put everything in an iframe.  This has it's own set of limitations: If your content can fit into a box, you can get around problem #1 by having your content write an iframe and explicitly set the content, thus skirting around the issue, since the iframe and document will share the same domain. CSS Solution I've search far and wide for the solution to this, but there are unfortunately none.  The best you can do is explicitly override all possible properties that can be overridden, and override them to what you think their default value should be. Even when you override, there is no way to ensure a more targeted CSS rule won't override yours.  The best you can do here is to have your override rules target as specifically as possible and hope the parent document doesn't accidentally best it:  use an obscure or random ID on your content's parent element, and use !important on all property value definitions. another ways: 1) include the css code(file) of Yahoo CSS reset and then put everything inside this DIV: 2) or use The quick answer is use \"all:revert\" all:revert will RESET all the style properties on your element back to the original browser default UA style sheet property values. But it will not ERASE style properties like initial, returning them to a completely unstyled state. In the case of text or inherited properties, \"revert\" resets your element's CSS property back to its inherited values coming from your \"body\" element or the browser's default UA style value, not to the property\u2019s base style. For a non-inherited property, it resets it back again to the browser's UA default style sheet and not to the property\u2019s base style. \"all\" allows all properties to be affected. This is likely what you want to see. Problems Using \"all:revert\" \"all:revert\" is a newer CSS declaration that only works in more modern HTML5 browsers (post-2015), and even then has very poor support in certain modern browsers like Internet Explorer 1-11, Edge Trident, and some mobile browsers. None of the older, non-HTML5 browsers (pre-2010) will understand this declaration, so it will be ignored by a wide range of browsers, old and new. (See my mixed CSS solution down below that has fixes for Internet Explorer). Problems Using \"initial\" You can use \"initial\" or \"unset\" but you have to manually apply them for each property, and what is even worse, they will not return properties to the element's default display values as set by each browser's default UA style sheet, but \"initial\" will essentially erase the element's property values and create a completely unstyled element. For example, \"display:block\" on block level elements will be erased. Because the style property still needs a default value of some kind all block and non-block level elements with \"display\" will be changed to \"display:inline\" when you use \"display:initial\". You do not want to ever do this as it erases your styles AND the browser's default UA element styles from the selected element completely. My recommendation is AVOID using all:initial or any form of initial in CSS unless you are trying to erase an individual CSS property you cannot erase in any other way. Why? initial erases not just the styles you applied but all styles the browsers default UA style sheet applied. all:revert will not do this. In terms of using initial, it does have better support in Internet Explorer, as does its cousin, inherit. But only IE8+ understands initial. So, there are a wide range of problems with this property value. It is not reliable. The reason CSS works this way is all HTML elements come without any styling until the browser applies a default user-agent style sheet that gives all the HTML elements a base style. All HTML elements really have NO STYLES, and other than \"replaced\" elements like textarea and buttons, look alike until each browser's default UA sheet is applied. \"initial\" and \"unset\" would wipe away most of that from the browser. \"revert\" at least preserves their basic style set applied by the user's browser, and is therefore superior to \"initial\" and \"unset\". You can review all the various default style sheets that come with browsers in the link below. A LIST OF DEFAULT BROWSER STYLE SHEETS: https://meiert.com/en/blog/user-agent-style-sheets/ NOW FOR AN EVEN BETTER SOLUTION There are two ideas here being confused: Those are two very different concepts people here are confusing. Because each browser often had default, out-of-the-box element and layout styles that looked slightly different, people came up with the idea of the \"reset\" or \"reboot\" style sheet to align all the browsers BEFORE applying custom CSS. Bootstrap now does this, for example. But that had nothing to do with people wanting to return to the browser's default look and feel. The problem was not the building of these custom \"reset\" style sheets, it is figuring out what the default CSS was for each browser and each element BEFORE any styles were applied. Most found out you cant rebuild an existing clean cascade until you \"clear out\" all styles already applied. But how to get back to the default browser styling? For some this meant going beyond returning the elements to the browsers UA style sheet that comes with the browser. Many wanted to reset back to \"initial\" property values which has NOTHING to do with the browser's default style, but really the properties defaults. This is dangerous as in the case of \"display\" pushes block level elements back to \"inline\" and breaks table layouts and other things. So I do NOT agree with users here using \"initial\" to reset anything or custom reset classes that change every property back to some arbitrary base value set. A better solution to me has always been to attempt to try and return all core element styling back to the browser's UA style sheet values, which is what all our end-users are using anyway. If you are creating a new website, you don't have to do this. You start with the browser's default styles and style over them. Its only after you've added third-party CSS products, or found yourself with complicated CSS cascades, that you want to figure out how to return to the browser default style sheet values. For this reason, I'm for creating your own \"reset\" sheet to reset all the elements to one common style first that's shared by all old and new browsers as a first step. You then have a solid framework that's much easier to revert to without going back to the browser defaults. You are simply building on a reset common core set of element style values. Once build your own \"reset\" sheet, one that ADDS not ALTERS the browsers UA styles, you have a site that's very easy to modify. The only problem remaining then is when you have a site that does NOT have such a reset sheet, or have that complex third party CSS and need to try and return to the browser UA styles. How do you do that? I realize Internet Explorer has forced us too manually reset every property to get back to any sort of reset. But pushing those property values all back to \"initial\" destroys the browser UA style sheet values completely! BAD IDEA! A better way is to simply use \"all:revert\" for non-IE  browsers on every element using a wildcard, and \"inherit\" only for a handful of inherited root-level properties found in the \"html\" and \"body\" elements that affect all inheriting children in the page. (see below). I'm NOT for these huge resets of properties using \"initial\" or going back to some imaginary standard we assume all browsers or IE will use. For starters \"initial\" has poor support in IE and doesn't reset values to element defaults, only property defaults. But its also pointless if you are going to create a reset sheet to align all elements to a common style. In that case its pointless to clear out styles and start over. So here is my simple solution that in most cases does enough to reset what text-based values sift down into IE from the root and use \"all:revert\" for all non-IE browsers to force non-inherited values back to the browser's UA style sheet completely, giving you a true restart. This does not interfere with higher level classes and styles layered over your element styles, which should always be the goal anyway. Its why I'm NOT for these custom reset classes which is tedious and unnecessary and doesn't return the element to its browser UA style anyway. Notice the slightly more selective selectors below which would write over, for example, Bootstrap's \"reboot\" style values, returning them to the browser default styles. These would not reset element styles on elements for IE, of course, but for non-IE browsers and most inheritable text styling it would return elements in most agents to the UA style sheets that come with browsers: If you happen to be using sass in a build system, one way to do this that will work in all the major browsers is to wrap all your style imports with a :not() selector like so... Then you can use the disable class on a container and the sub-content won't have any of your styles. Of course all your styles will now be prepended with the :not() selector, so it's a little fugly, but works well. I do not recommend using the answer that has been marked as correct here. It is a huge blob of CSS which tries to cover everything. I would suggest that you evaluate how to remove the style from an element on a per case basis. Lets say for SEO purposes you need to include an H1 on a page which has no actual heading in the design. You might want to make the nav link of that page an H1 but ofcourse you do not want that navigation link to display as a giant H1 on the page. What you should do is wrap that element in an h1 tag and inspect it. See what CSS styles are being applied specifically to the h1 element. Lets say I see the following styles applied to the element. Now you need to pin point the exact style which are applied to the H1 and unset them in a css class. This would look something like the following: This is much cleaner and does not just dump a random blob of code into your css which you don't know what it's actually doing. Now you can add this class to your h1 You mentioned mobile-first sites... For a responsive design, it's certainly possible to override small-screen styles with large-screen styles. But you might not need to. Try this: Those media queries don't overlap, so their rules don't override each other. This makes it easier to maintain each set of styles separately. BETTER SOLUTION Download \"copy/paste\" stylesheet\u200e to reset css properties to default (UA style): https://github.com/monmomo04/resetCss.git Thanks@Milche Patern!  I was really looking for reset/default style properties value. My first try was to copy the computed value from the browser Dev tool of the root(html) element. But as it computed, it would have looked/worked different on every system.  For those who encounter a browser crash when trying to use the asterisk * to reset the style of the children elements, and as I knew it didn't work for you, I have replaced the asterisk \"*\" with  all the HTML tags name instead. The browser didn't crash; I am on Chrome Version 46.0.2490.71 m.  At last, it's good to mention that those properties will reset the style to the default style of topest root element  but not to the initial value for each HTML element. \u200eSo to correct this, I have taken the \"user-agent\" styles of webkit based browser and implemented it under the \"reset-this\" class. Download \"copy/paste\" stylesheet\u200e to reset css properties to default (UA style): https://github.com/monmomo04/resetCss.git User-agent style: Browsers' default CSS for HTML elements http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/Source/WebCore/css/html.css Css specifity (pay attention to specifity) : https://css-tricks.com/specifics-on-css-specificity/ https://github.com/monmomo04/resetCss.git In my specific scenario i wanted to skip applying common styles to a specific part of the page, better illustrated like this: After messing with CSS reset which didn't bring much success (mainly because of rules precedence and complex stylesheet hierarchy), brought up ubiquitous jQuery to the rescue, which did the job very quickly and reasonably dirty: (Now tell how evil it is to use JS to deal with CSS :-) ) For those of you trying to figure out how to actually remove the styling from the element only, without removing the css from the files, this solution works with jquery: if you set your CSS within classes,  you can easly remove them using jQuery removeClass() Method.  The code below removes .element class: If no parameter is specified, this method will remove  ALL class names from the selected elements.

I create a property at .h header file of the class and then i synthesize. What is the difference between and Both work but what is the purpose of using the first one or the second one. Any help appreciated. First of all you need not write @synthesize propertyname anymore. In Objective-C when you declare a property, compiler auto generates its accessor methods for you by default. These accessor methods can be getter and setter if property is both read and write property else just a getter if it's a readonly property. Compiler uses internal variables (called iVar) under the hood of these accessor methods implementation. (You can obviously provide your own implementation of these accessor methods and also provide your own internal variables as well) What is the difference between @synthesize propertyname; and @synthesize propertyname = _propertyname; when you declare a @synthesize propertyname; compiler auto generates and uses an iVar named propertyname and uses it in its default accessor implementation and you can also use it as propertyname in your .m file as compiler has already declared it for you. when you declare a @synthesize propertyname = _propertyname; compiler auto generates and uses a iVar named _propertyname and uses it in its default accessor implementation and you can also use it as _propertyname in your .m file as compiler has already declared it for you. Broadly speaking the general difference between the two statement is just the change in name of iVar (usage of it are different though) what is the purpose of using the first one or the second one. As I already mentioned you need not use either of them in a normal usecase. Compiler already does that for you. We used to write @synthesize propertyname; when we neither had any specific reservation about the name of ivar nor wanted to provide our own private variable as ivar to a specific property (Explained in detail below). This was simpler than explicitly specifying the name of iVar and we knew that compiler will generate an ivar with same name as property for us. we typically wrote @synthesize propertyname = _propetyname when @synthesize propertyname; wasn't available or when we wanted our iVar to follow a specific nomenclature ('_' following name of property) or when we wanted to use our own private variable as iVar to a property. In both the cases @synthesize was handy because it would relieve us from writing a boiler plate code like adding setter and getter methods for properties declared. How to use custom variable as ivar for a property? If you look at the implementation you will see that property name is backed by a internal variable named blaBlaName and not by the typical compiler generated ivar like name or _name. As of today the only reason I see for the usage of @synthesize when you wanna use your custom internal variable to back the property you have declared. Otherwise I dont see any point in writing neither @synthesize propertyname; or @synthesize propertyname = _propertyname; site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1629": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69550649/choosing-items-from-a-list-under-skew-normal-distribution-python-and-scipy", "Choosing Items from a List under Skew-Normal Distribution (Python and Scipy?)

I have following problem. I have a b-form-input where I'm searching for my number over my b-form-select. So I'm selecting 3 values and get a number in my input field and other way around - so it's an Autofill. This works fine - and because of that I think I don't need to show you the code. The problem is that I want to disable all selects (instead of the first) till the field before was selected. I have problem that if I have multiple elements all will be updated. So if I input something in Input1 in the first element the second Input of all other elements will be !disabled Additional Info: IDParent is a prop! If you need any additional code, I can update my question! my script: What you are missing is a multi-layer model for your data which you can call in your searchNumber function and call for your :disabled attribute. In your v-for=\"(IDChild, indexChild) in inputs\" you could use IDChild or indexChild for that. For example you would call :disabled=\"disabledInput2[indexChild]\". That way you would refer to disabledInput2 with the specific indexChild. You also need to handle this in your function, for example this.disabledInput2[indexChild] = false;. Basically it\u00b4s the same as storing multi-layer data in the same object with v-model. Let me know, if this helped you. EDIT: Generally Example I\u00b4ve created the following properties for this example. We have myNumberInput as an object to handle multiple input fields for numbers. mySelectionData provides a simple collection of two objects with 3 selection arrays each. myDisableData is the object that will handle multiple disabled attributes for this selections: From the mySelectionData object, we will build our myDisableData with this function: This will loop trough our \"parents\", assign their index to myDisableData and also loop trough the \"childs\" and assign their index to myDisableData with the \"parent\"-index as a pointer. After that we have a multi-layer object which is able to provide diabled= true or false for each selection. The html for this example looks like this: As I don\u00b4t use BootstrapVue, my html looks different, but I guess you will get the trick. You simply now refer to the three object by the index of \"parent\" and \"child\". In this example the function enableMySelection will enable a selection depending on the number entered in the input. The function looks like this: So if you enter \"2\" in your first input, it will enable the second selection of the first block. If you enter 1 in the second input, it will enable the first selection in the second block. As I said, this is just a generally example but this should be enough to help you define the structure to handle your multiple inputs and selections. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1637": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69550629/upper-case-conversion-convert-the-first-letter-of-each-word-in-the-string-to-u", "Upper case conversion - convert the first letter of each word in the string to uppercase Some test cases are not working.

Similarly the first character of the sentence is upper cased without checking if this first letter is a letter. It may be better to use a boolean flag which should be reset upon applying an upper case to a letter.  Also, StringBuilder should be used instead of concatenating a String in the loop.

Now I'm facing a problem joining debug strings together, as I have to work with c strings. I need to have debugMessageOnStack on the stack. Consider following example: I need a string like \"My favorite color is mountbatten pink\" I know it is pretty easy to calculate DEBUG_MESSAGE_LENGTH by hand, but i want it to be calculated dynamically, so I don't have to recalculate it by hand everytime I add a new color string that's longer than all existing color strings. Theoretically it should be possible as every string length in colors is known before compiling, but I don't know how I can do it. Thanks! First of all, \"but i want it to be calculated dynamically\" doesn't make much sense since your array must be large enough to handle the worst case scenario. Your code can't run off into the woods with stack overflow during the worst case scenario, so you could simply allocate the array large enough for that one. It doesn't make sense to \"save some stack space\" when not under the worst case scenario, since this is just a local variable anyhow and will get deallocated after use no matter size. Instead of an array of strings, use an array of structs: That way everything is stored in flash and computed at compile-time. If you are pedantic about reducing code repetition, then you could add a mysterious macro (generally not recommended): Generally one should avoid using a variable sized object on stack. First, there is a risk that the size of string can grow too much to be kept on stack. The second, stack allocation with automatic VLAs or alloca() is usually less efficient than for a fixed size object (though still faster than malloc()). Anyway, to deal with a unknown size string on the stack you could use snprintf function. The function works like printf() but it stores the characters to a string. However, if one passes NULL as a buffer and 0 as size it returns a number of characters that would be stored to  a buffer. The string would be produced in two passes: It may be a good idea to wrap the message generation into a helper to avoid repeating: The advantage of this methodology is that it is very generic and reusable. If your compiler supports VLAs the you can use this: site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1665": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69550562/aws-alb-health-checks-how-to-prevent-health-checks-before-server-is-up-and-run", "AWS ALB Health checks - How to prevent health checks before server is up and running?

This returns: I can't seem to figure out how to \"reach up\" to the state level of the groupby to total up the sales for the entire state to calculate the fraction. Paul H's answer is right that you will have to make a second groupby object, but you can calculate the percentage in a simpler way -- just groupby the state_office and divide the sales column by its sum. Copying the beginning of Paul H's answer: Returns: You need to make a second groupby object that groups by the states, and then use the div method: the level='state' kwarg in div tells pandas to broadcast/join the dataframes base on the values in the state level of the index. For conciseness I'd use the SeriesGroupBy: For multiple groups you have to use transform (using Radical's df): This seems to be slightly more performant than the other answers (just less than twice the speed of Radical's answer, for me ~0.08s).

For me, this is still a useful answer, though not in its current form. For quick EDA on smaller datasets, apply allows you use method chaining to write this in a single line. We therefore remove the need decide on a variable's name, which is actually very computationally expensive for your most valuable resource (your brain!!). Here is the modification, 10.6 ms \u00b1 81.5 \u00b5s per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each) So no one is going care about 6ms on a small dataset. However, this is 3x speed up and, on a larger dataset with high cardinality groupbys this is going to make a massive difference. Adding to the above code, we make a DataFrame with shape (12,000,000, 3) with 14412 state categories and 600 office_ids, Using Andy's, 2 s \u00b1 10.4 ms per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) and exp1orer 19 s \u00b1 77.1 ms per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) So now we see x10 speed up on large, high cardinality datasets. Be sure to UV these three answers if you UV this one!! I realize there are already good answers here. I nevertheless would like to contribute my own, because I feel for an elementary, simple question like this, there should be a short solution that is understandable at a glance. It should also work in a way that I can add the percentages as a new column, leaving the rest of the dataframe untouched. Last but not least, it should generalize in an obvious way to the case in which there is more than one grouping level (e.g., state and country instead of only state). The following snippet fulfills these criteria: Note that if you're still using Python 2, you'll have to replace the x in the denominator of the lambda term by float(x). I know that this is an old question, but exp1orer's answer is very slow for datasets with a large number unique groups (probably because of the lambda).  I built off of their answer to turn it into an array calculation so now it's super fast! Below is the example code: Create the test dataframe with 50,000 unique groups When grouped it looks like: Array method of finding percentage: This method takes about ~0.15 seconds Top answer method (using lambda function): This method takes about ~21 seconds to produce the same result. The result: The most elegant way to find percentages across columns or index is to use pd.crosstab. Sample Data The output dataframe is like this Just specify the index, columns and the values to aggregate. The normalize keyword will calculate % across index or columns depending upon the context. You can sum the whole DataFrame and divide by the state total: Returns But note that this only works because all columns other than state are numeric, enabling summation of the entire DataFrame. For example, if office_id is character instead, you get an error: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'str' Output: I think this would do the trick in 1 line: Simple way I have used is a merge after the 2 groupby's then doing simple division. Returns: As someone who is also learning pandas I found the other answers a bit implicit as pandas hides most of the work behind the scenes. Namely in how the operation works by automatically matching up column and index names. This code should be equivalent to a step by step version of @exp1orer's accepted answer With the df, I'll call it by the alias state_office_sales: state_total_sales is state_office_sales grouped by total sums in index level 0 (leftmost). Because the two dataframes share an index-name and a column-name pandas will find the appropriate locations through shared indexes like: To illustrate this even better, here is a partial total with a XX that has no equivalent. Pandas will match the location based on index and column names, where there is no overlap pandas will ignore it: This becomes very clear when there are no shared indexes or columns. Here missing_index_totals is equal to state_total_sales except that it has a no index-name. One-line solution: This returns a Series of per-office ratios -- can be used on it's own or assigned to the original Dataframe. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1675": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69550544/running-pod-takes-a-long-time-for-internal-service-to-be-accessible", "Running Pod takes a long time for internal service to be accessible I have implemented a gRPC service, build it into a container, and deployed it using k8s, in particular AWS EKS, as a DaemonSet.

The way I did it in v4 was using makeStyles like that: Page.style.js: Page.js: makeStyles is now legacy and I heard it will be deprecated next version. What is the proper way to separate styling and component into different files in v5? The recommended styling APIs in v5 are styled()/sx prop. If you use styled, you can separate the styling code by creating a reusable styled component. The sx prop is more suitable for inline one-off style so it's not the best choice to use in this scenario: Besides that, you can also use variant in MUI v5. The way it works is you create a custom styles and assign a name for it called variant so instead of specifying a className like before, you set the variant prop like this: Custom variant can be created using createTheme.

I was thinking ceiling . div, but it doesn't work because (/) returns a function and ceiling takes a Double as its argument. There's a fun site called https://pointfree.io - it provides a solution to your problem like this: ceilingDiv = (ceiling .) . (/). It looks ugly because point-free composition with multiple arguments is a pain. Sometimes it's achieved by using . sections like here, sometimes by using an Applicative instance of functions and the <*> operator. I think your solution with curry-uncurry is nice. It deals with passing multiple arguments by wrapping them into one tuple. Compositions with multiple arguments are usually best just left in point-ful form. None of the alternatives is as clean and clear. Do make use of composition- and grouping operators, but don't golf away arguments just for the sake of it. What you can certainly do is eta-reduce the b argument but I'd leave it at that. Even that is IMO less clean than the original 2-argument form, because the division operator needs to be sectioned. When directly passing compositions to a higher-order function then it can make sense to aim a bit more agressively point-free, to avoid lambda bindings. The composition package has a whole bunch of operators for composing with more arguments.

Is there a way I can add a delay to the submission such that the animation is completed first? In this code, it doesn't even get a chance to run the javascript. If you need to use the \"submit\", then you can simply hide the submit button itself, and hang the listener on the button that will call its animations, and then, when you need it, submit. It is also possible without creating a hidden input through the form submission. I think this option is better. Using event.preventDefault() you can halt the normal behavior of the form.

So what I essentially want is the functionality of a Spring Data REST exported controller like projections and HAL formatted JSON. Is that possible to do in a custom controller? I found a similar question here but it didnt help me. Edit 1: There is no bi-directional relationship on Student entity. Also I am using the PersistentEntityResourceAssembler to assemble the Student entity for response body which will render any @ManyToOne association as links as explained by Oliver Gierke in this answer so I am not sure how recursion is possible PersistentEntityResourceAssembler - which is usually injected into the controller method. It renders a single entity in a Spring Data REST way, which means that associations pointing to managed types will be rendered as links etc. Since you have an infinite recursion problem, it simply means that it is serializing the parent then its child and then the parent of the child and then the child again... Do you see where this is going? :) You have not posted your entities so I cannot take a relevant example. But I would use @JsonManagedReference -> Parent and @JsonBackReference -> Child. Try annotating your Relationship Attributes with these two.

The problem is that JS might be a bit too complicated for my (non techie) users, as well as completely unnecessary for the basic functionality I require.

Its job is to expose the build targets build-modules, build-utils and build-library. If it is not given any target, it builds the all target which depends on all of these.  We can also think about, for instance, make build-utils being directly invoked. Each build-<whatever> corresponds to a <whatever> dir without the build- prefix. For instance to update the target build-utils, the action is to recursively invoke make with -C utils step2 as the arguments: change to the utils directory and look for a Makefile there, invoking its step2 target. This Makefile has a flaw: the targets all and the build-<dir> targets are all phony, but there is no .PHONY: declaration for them. This means that make will probe the filesystem, looking for files named all, and build-modules, etc. If you create files with these names, such as by touch build-modules or touch all, the Makefile will then malfunction. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1773": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69550328/postgres-alter-column-type-deleting-those-that-cant-be-converted", "Postgres: Alter column type deleting those that can't be converted I need to change the type of a column from varchar(255) to uuid.

There are several modules for that, like JSON: And then use it like a normal hash reference: $href->{apiVersion} Perl doesn't expand subroutine calls in a double-quoted string. In this line of code, content() is a subroutine call. So Perl sees this as: And if you try to print most Perl objects, you'll get the hash reference along with the name of the class - hence HTTP::Response=HASH(0x2dffe80). You might think that you just need to break up your print() statement like this: But that's not going to work either. $request->content doesn't return a Perl data structure, it returns a JSON-encoded string. You need to decode it into a data structure before you can access the individual elements. But it might be cleaner to do the decoding outside of the print() statement.

If I were to guess, I'd say you're running into one of 2 problems: You need to make sure that all the necessary ports used by Cassandra are exposed between each nodes. You also need to make sure that the local ports mapped to container ports are not already in use by another container. For example, use CQL port 9041 and gossip port 7001 for node 1, 9042 + 7002 for node 2, and so on. If you just want to try using Cassandra on a laptop, have a look at DataStax Desktop (free to use). It allows you deploy Cassandra in Docker containers without the hassle of manually setting it up. There's also K8ssandra.io -- our opinionated deployment of Cassandra on Kubernetes (fully open-source and free) using the cass-operator and with all the admin tools already bundled in: Finally if you just want to build apps for Cassandra, Astra DB has a free tier that doesn't require a credit card and you can launch a Cassandra cluster in just 5 clicks. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1784": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69550302/want-to-find-the-top-level-hierarchy-of-an-employee-in-an-organization", "want to find the top level hierarchy of an employee in an organization Using the link How to find the top level hierarchy of one column from another column in pyspark? we found all the levels for each employee but from level how can we found below o/p enter image description here site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1785": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69550296/is-there-a-option-to-add-a-subject-to-the-mark", "Is there a option to add a subject to the mark?

Just like this: Caused by positioning The problem is that many modern applications use fixed, absolute and relative positioning to layout their user interface. The above problem occurs when the Modal dialog sits within a container that has any parent that uses either fixed, absolute or relative positioning. The change post 3.34 of bootstrap was that the modal overlay was moved to the DOM root below  while the actual modal dialog content in this case is sitting inside of a separate nested DOM structure. The problem occurs because the overlay and the other content container are not relative to each other so the position:absolute (or fixed) and their z-index values are not directly related to each other. The easiest solution is to move the modal dialog outside of any container and just declare it under the  element, or - remove any absolute, fixed or relative positioning.

This, in turn, is governed by the lifetime of the Java ClassLoader that loaded the library: In addition, native libraries can be unloaded when their corresponding class loaders are garbage collected.

Why I hear you ask? Great question! I will explain... So, after a bit of searching over the past couple weeks I have found that the only effective method of pushing new dataframes to an existing xlsx (template) file (without overwriting or destroying cell formulae) is to use openpyxl (with a helper function). With that understood, I need to be able to push a single string to the xlsx workbook without destroying the data loaded into it earlier in the script. The easiest method that came to mind was creating single 1x1 dataframes containing the strings and push that into the workbook using the method elluded to earlier. Please let me know if there is a simple way to achieve this, or an alternative using openpyxl. Or some other alternative. I know that the method I am purposing is not at all elegant, and is probably a great example of improper use of dataframes (obviously not designed for handling single instances, but rather is for larger structures).

I want to trigger an event handler on the viewmodel whenever a CheckBox is clicked. At them moment my Click property of the CheckBox is complaining that Checked_Triggered is expecting a property. Could someone explain what I am doing wrong and show a solution? In my viewmodel called SimulatorControlViewModel: You cannot bind to a method that way, you can only bind to properties. Depending on whether you are using some kind of MVVM framework there could be a solution offered by that framework. Another way would be to use a binding to a command property defined in your viewmodel. Have a look here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/3531935/1213316 First of all, you cannot bind an event handler to an event in XAML. Even if it was possible, your binding would be wrong. Your view model is set as the DataContext of a control, but RelativeSource is used to refer to controls. What you would do is specify the type of the parent control as AncestorType, that has the desired data context set and specify the property path like DataContext.YourPropertyToBind, e.g.: Now to the core of your issue, executing an action in the view model if the CheckBox Click event is raised. There are multiple options, depending on your requirements. If the items in your DigitalFilterSubsystems are a custom type, e.g. Subsystem, you can expose a property IsChecked (or give it a more meaningful name for what checked means). In the setter of the property, call a method that acts on the current value of the property. Then simply bind the property in XAML to IsChecked of CheckBox. You can use a command to encapsulate the logic and expose it as a bindable object. For that you need a relay command or often called delegate command implementation. You can read about the details of these concepts in the following article. A relay command simply takes an action that it encapsulates as an object and optionally a can execute predicate that determines if the action can be executed. This object can be exposed from a view model and bound in XAML. Relay commands implement the ICommand interface and WPF knows how to handle it. You can copy a relay command implementation from anywhere, there are plenty of implementations, most MVVM frameworks already provide their own. If you have chosen one, expose a command property in your SimulatorControlViewModel and initialize it in the constructor with the method to be called (this could vary depending on the concrete command implementation that you use). Then bind the Clicked command to the Command property of the CheckBox and bind the CommandParameter to its own IsChecked property (this is the parameter that is passed to the ExecuteChecked method. You can install the Microsoft.Xaml.Behaviors.Wpf NuGet package, which contains CallMethodAction that allows a method to be called on an object when an event is raised. Caution: The method signature must match public void Checked_Triggered() exactly (public, return void and no arguments), otherwise you will get an exception stating that the method was not found. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1833": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69550181/how-do-i-send-both-file-and-text-in-one-api-request-in-jmeter", "How do I send both file and text in one api request in Jmeter I have to send a post request in jmeter which contains a multipart/form-data body.

Because the author wants to make the filtering customer method to be more generic.So he allows the client to input a predicate to define their filtering logic. Then he can build a more specialized version of the filtering method on top of the generic one by configuring the filter predicate and finally call this generic method.

[duplicate] I have my database on remote Linux machine, and I want to connect using SSH and PHP functions (I am currently using ssh2 library for that). I tried using mysql_connect, but it gives me can't access (although I have granted permission) when I tried using this function: I got error \"mysqli_connect() expects parameter 6 to be string, resource given\". How can I resolve this? Set up an SSH tunnel to your MySQL database server (through a Jumpbox proxy for security). Depending on your requirements, you can use a GUI MySQL client with SSH Tunnelling support built-in such as Visual Studio Code Forwarding a port / creating SSH tunnel, TablePlus or use PuTTY to setup local port forwarding. On macOS, I like Secure Pipes or TablePlus. Step 1. The key here is the '-L' switch which tells ssh we're requesting local port forwarding. I've chosen to use port 3307 above. All traffic on my local machine directed to this port will now be 'port-forwarded' via my ssh client to the ssh server running on the host at address ssh-jumpbox.com. The Jumpbox ssh proxy server will decrypt the traffic and establish a network connection to your MySQL database server on your behalf, 10.3.1.55:3306, in this case. The MySQL database server sees the connection coming in from your Jumpbox' internal network address. Local Port Forwarding Syntax The syntax is a little tricky but can be seen as: If you're interested in the other switches, they are: -f (go to background) -N (do not execute a remote command) -g (allow remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports) Private Key Authentication, add (-i) switch to above: -i /path/to/private-key Step 2. Tell your local MySQL client to connect through your SSH tunnel via the local port 3307 on your machine (-h 127.0.0.1) which now forwards all traffic sent to it through the SSH tunnel you established in step 1. Data exchange between client and server is now sent over the encrypted SSH connection and is secure. Security note Don\u2019t tunnel directly to your database server. Having a database server directly accessible from the internet is a huge security liability. Make the tunnel target address the internet address of your Jumpbox/Bastion Host (see example in step 1) and your database target the internal IP address of your database server on the remote network. SSH will do the rest. Step 3. Now connect up your PHP application with: Credit to Chris Snyder's great article detailing ssh command line tunnelling for MySQL connectivity. Unfortunately, the ssh2 tunnel offered by php doesn't seem able to handle a remote mysql connection as you cannot specify the local port to tunnel (it only works with port 22 or whatever ssh port your remote server is running on).  My solution to this is to just open the tunnel via exec() operator and connect as usual from there: I was looking for the same thing, but I prefer not to need external commands and manage external processes. So at some point I thought, how hard can it be to write a pure PHP MySQL client which can operate on any PHP stream? It took me about half a day, based on the MySQL protocol documentation. https://gist.github.com/UCIS/4e509915ed221660e58f5169267da004 You can use this with the SSH2 library or any other stream: It does not implement the complete mysqli API, but it should work with all plain-text queries. Please be careful if you decide to use this, I haven't thoroughly tested the code yet and the string escaping code has not been reviewed. According to the docs, that last parameter is supposed to be a socket or pipe name, something like '/var/run/mysql/mysql.sock'.  Since you're not connecting using a UNIX socket, that doesn't apply to you... so try just leaving it out. even i tried it by doing ssh both by root credentials and and public private key pair, but it allows me to conect through command line but not through php code. I tried by creating tunnel also(by using ssh2 functions),ans running shell commands from php code(system,exec etc), nothing worked. Finally i tried ssh2 function to execute shell command and it finally worked :) Here is code, if it helps you:---- it worked for me try this if want to use php functions specifically. Make sure that your username and password that you are connecting with has the right hostname permissions.  I believe you can use '%' for a wildcard.  Also if  you are connecting to remote machine (which I would assume you are if you are trying to ssh into it) that is not on your local network you will have to forward the ports on your router where the server is for outside traffic to be able to connect to it. http://www.lanexa.net/2011/08/create-a-mysql-database-username-password-and-permissions-from-the-command-line/ I believe that the reason I (and I suppose most people) have a problem getting this to work is because the user in the mysql server is set to only allow from \"localhost\" and not 127.0.0.1, the IP address of localhost. I got this to work by doing the following steps: SSH normally into your server, and log in with the mysql root user, then issue the command: The key of course, is specifying 127.0.0.1 above. You can now start your local SSH tunnel to the remote MySQL server, like so: -v makes ssh operate in verbose mode, which kind of helps to see what's happening. For example, you'll see debugging output like this in your terminal console when you attempt a connection: and output like this when you close the connection: -N makes ssh issue no commands, and just wait instead after establishing connection. -g allows remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports. Not completely sure if this is necessary but it might be useful for multiplexing multiple connections through the same SSH tunnel. -L This is the main parameter that specifies the local port 33306 to connect to the remote host's local IP address 127.0.0.1 and the remote host's mysql port, usually 3306. You can use whatever mechanisms / other parameters needed after this to connect through SSH to your remote host. In my case, I use key files configured in my ~/.ssh/config so I just need to specify user@host to get in. Issuing the command like this runs SSH in the foreground, so I can easily close it with Ctrl + C. If you want to run this tunnel in a background process you can add -f to do this. The SSH tunnel running from above on your localhost will behave exactly like as if your mysql was running on 127.0.0.1. I use port 33306 (note the triple 3) which lets me run my local sql server at its normal port. You can now connect as you would normally do. The mysql command on the terminal looks like this: where -P (capital P) specifies the port where your SSH tunnel's local end is accepting connections. It's important to use the 127.0.0.1 IP address instead of localhost because the mysql cli will try to possibly use the linux socket to connect. For PHP connection strings, my data source name string (for my Yii2 config) looks like this: Passwords, and usernames are specified as normal. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1852": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69550142/write-data-into-first-column-with-header-perl", "Write data into first column with header (Perl) may i know how to write data from text files to only first column of excel file with header using perl script?

The values will be coming from text boxes. The Date object will do what you want - construct one for each date, then compare them using the >, <, <= or >=. The ==, !=, ===, and !== operators require you to use date.getTime() as in to be clear just checking for equality directly with the date objects won't work I suggest you use drop-downs or some similar constrained form of date entry rather than text boxes, though, lest you find yourself in input validation hell. For the curious, date.getTime() documentation: Returns the numeric value of the specified date as the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC. (Negative values are returned for prior times.) The easiest way to compare dates in javascript is to first convert it to a Date object and then compare these date-objects. Below you find an object with three functions: dates.compare(a,b) Returns a number: dates.inRange (d,start,end) Returns a boolean or NaN: dates.convert Used by the other functions to convert their input to a date object. The input can be . Compare < and > just as usual, but anything involving = should use a + prefix. Like so:  The relational operators < <= > >= can be used to compare JavaScript dates: However, the equality operators == != === !== cannot be used to compare (the value of) dates because: You can compare the value of dates for equality using any of these methods: Both Date.getTime() and Date.valueOf() return the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00 UTC. Both Number function and unary + operator call the valueOf() methods behind the scenes. By far the easiest method is to subtract one date from the other and compare the result.  Comparing dates in JavaScript is quite easy... JavaScript has built-in comparison system for dates which makes it so easy to do the comparison... Just follow these steps for comparing 2 dates value, for example you have 2 inputs which each has a Date value in String and you to compare them... 1. you have 2 string values you get from an input and you'd like to compare them, they are as below: 2. They need to be Date Object to be compared as date values, so simply convert them to date, using new Date(), I just re-assign them for simplicity of explanation, but you can do it anyway you like: 3. Now simply compare them,  using the > < >= <=  Compare day only (ignoring time component): Usage: I no longer recommend modifying the prototype of built-in objects. Try this instead:  N.B. the year/month/day will be returned for your timezone; I recommend using a timezone-aware library if you want to check if two dates are on the same day in a different timezone. e.g. what format? If you construct a Javascript Date object, you can just subtract them to get a milliseconds difference (edit: or just compare them) : The simple way is, Note - Compare Only Date Part: When we compare two date in javascript. It takes hours, minutes and seconds also into consideration.. So If we only need to compare date only, this is the approach: Now: if date1.valueOf()> date2.valueOf() will work like a charm. SHORT ANSWER Here is a function that return {boolean} if the from dateTime > to dateTime Demo in action Explanation jsFiddle since you are now having both datetime in number type you can compare them with any Comparison operations ( >, < ,= ,!= ,== ,!== ,>= AND <=) Then if you are familiar with C# Custom Date and Time Format String this library should do the exact same thing and help you format your date and time dtmFRM whether you are passing in date time string or unix format Usage DEMO all you have to do is passing any of these format pacified in the library js file you use this code, And also check this link http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_obj_date.asp BEWARE THE TIMEZONE A javascript date has no notion of timezone. It's a moment in time (ticks since the epoch) with handy functions for translating to and from strings in the \"local\" timezone. If you want to work with dates using date objects, as everyone here is doing, you want your dates to represent UTC midnight at the start of the date in question. This is a common and necessary convention that lets you work with dates regardless of the season or timezone of their creation. So you need to be very vigilant to manage the notion of timezone, particularly when you create your midnight UTC Date object. Most of the time, you will want your date to reflect the timezone of the user. Click if today is your birthday. Users in NZ and US click at the same time and get different dates. In that case, do this... Sometimes, international comparability trumps local accuracy. In that case, do this... Now you can directly compare your date objects as the other answers suggest. Having taken care to manage timezone when you create, you also need to be sure to keep timezone out when you convert back to a string representation. So you can safely use... And totally avoid everything else, especially... Via Moment.js Jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/guhokemk/1/ The method returns 1 if dateTimeA is greater than dateTimeB The method returns 0 if dateTimeA equals dateTimeB The method returns -1 if dateTimeA is less than dateTimeB Just to add yet another possibility to the many existing options, you could try: ...which seems to work for me.  Of course you do have to ensure that both dates are not undefined... This way we can ensure that a positive comparison is made if both are undefined also, or... ...if you prefer them not to be equal. Subtract two date get the difference in millisecond, if you get 0 it's the same date Say you got the date objects A and B, get their EPOC time value, then subtract to get the difference in milliseconds. That's all. To compare two date we can use date.js JavaScript library which can be found at : https://code.google.com/archive/p/datejs/downloads and use the Date.compare( Date date1, Date date2 ) method and it return a number which mean the following result: -1 = date1 is lessthan date2. 0 = values are equal. 1 = date1 is greaterthan date2. In order to create dates from free text in Javascript you need to parse it into the Date() object. You could use Date.parse() which takes free text tries to convert it into a new date but if you have control over the page I would recommend using HTML select boxes instead or a date picker such as the YUI calendar control or the jQuery UI Datepicker. Once you have a date as other people have pointed out you can use simple arithmetic to subtract the dates and convert it back into a number of days by dividing the number (in seconds) by the number of seconds in a day (60*60*24 = 86400). If following is your date format, you can use this code: It will check whether 20121121 number is bigger than 20121103 or not. Today 2020.02.27 I perform tests of chosen solutions on Chrome v80.0, Safari v13.0.5 and Firefox 73.0.1 on MacOs High Sierra v10.13.6  In below snippet solutions used in performance tests are presented. You can perform test in you machine HERE  Results for chrome  An Improved version of the code posted by \"some\" usage: I usually store Dates as timestamps(Number) in databases. When I need to compare, I simply compare among those timestamps or convert it to Date Object and then compare with > <if necessary. Note that == or === does not work properly unless your variables are references of the same Date Object. Convert those Date objects to timestamp(number) first and then compare equality of them. Before comparing the Dates object, try setting both of their milliseconds to zero like Date.setMilliseconds(0);. In some cases where the Date object is dynamically created in javascript, if you keep printing the Date.getTime(), you'll see the milliseconds changing, which will prevent the equality of both dates. Let's suppose that you deal with this 2014[:-/.]06[:-/.]06 or this 06[:-/.]06[:-/.]2014 date format, then you may compare dates this way As you can see, we strip separator(s) and then compare integers. Use this code to compare the date using javascript.

You are asking about two different command-lines, and while the failures in running them via the wsl command have the same root-cause, the underlying failures are likely slightly different. In both cases, the wsl <command> invocation results in a non-login, non-interactive shell where the command simply \"runs and exits\". Since the shell is non-login/non-interactive, your startup files (such as ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_profile, among others) are not being processed. When you run: ... the DISPLAY variable is not set, since, as you said, you normally set it in your ~/.bashrc. Try using: That will force bash to run as a login (-l), interactive (-i) shell.  The DISPLAY should be set correctly, and it should run konsole. Note that the quotes probably aren't necessary in this case, but are useful for delineating the commands you are passing to bash.  More complicated command-lines can be passed in via the quotes. As for: That's likely a similar problem.  You are doing the right thing by setting DISPLAY in your script, but I notice that you aren't using a fully-qualified path it.  This would normally work, of course, if your script is in a directory on the $PATH. But I'm guessing that you might add that directory to the $PATH in your startup config, which means (again) that it isn't being set in this non-login, non-interactive shell. As before, try: You could also use a fully-qualified path, of course. And, I'm fairly sure you are going to run into an issue with trying to put konsole in the background via the script.  When WSL exits, and the bash shell process ends, the child konsole process will terminate as well. You could get around this with a nohup in the script, but then you also need to redirect the stderr.  It's probably easiest just to move the & from the script itself to the command-line.  Change your k.sh to: Then run it with: Finally, a side note that when and if you can upgrade to Windows 11, it will automatically create Windows Start Menu entries for any Linux GUI app you install that creates a .desktop file.

Any help would be appreciated. There are two issues with your code. Firstly the properties you want to iterate over are not in Data, they are in Options. So at the end you have to use data.data[key], not data[key]. The other issue is something that is more common. Object.keys returns an array of Strings. Mapping over it these and using them as any property say data.data[key] will cause an error because TS is not sure if key is a property of Options (not every string is right?) Only some specific strings are properties of Options. And for that you will have to use an intermediate variable and typecast it.

I believe I manage to do what I initially intended. It's hard to use sscanf for the task, since one would have to previously allocate the memory necessary for sscanf to use. Which, in the context of the question, is unknown. However, @Cheatah suggested using strtok, which worked pretty fine. Here's the final version of the code, using it: input: output: The code can be improved in many ways. Some people pointed EOF is not properly checked within read_line(), and main can definitely be refactored in smaller functions. However the idea of using strtok() as a substitute to sscanf() even with an indefinite number of tokens, for that case, works.

My tutor is not available this week, or the next, so I take my questions here. I feel like my problem has to do with me not fully understanding how the global variables work yet, as I just started using them, or if I should even use them to store data for this purpose. The idea I have with this game is essentially to run on calling a bunch of functions that I will make when I need them to, because I feel like it is pretty efficient for what I know. Running this code gives the error \"positional argument is missing\" if you are to run it. What could I do better here? I tried to integrate a function to test it out too, so that it would be easier to give me assistance. tldr; how can I make the experience points system I am trying to envision work so that it saves the number of experience points that are gained, then adds that number to the new higher requirement of experience for the next level as in most RPG games? For example, upon adding five experience, the program errors out. Thanks in advance for reading this!

So far as I know, when we create an array or string, their names are pointers to their first elements. And the pointer, in this case, cannot be changed. However, this piece of code works: Why does this work well? Is it a good practice to swap strings (or arrays in general) in this way? When it is not a good idea to use this approach? Why does this work well? It does not work well. It seems to work well because you lie to your compiler and use insufficient test data. You claim to provide a pointer to a pointer. As a consequence this functions swaps as much bytes between two places as a pointer takes. That is 4 or 8 bytes on most systems. But then you pass addresses of arrays, not pointers to pointers: This is causing undefined behaviour. You are using casts because your compiler told you that this is crab if you remove them: As a result the function thinks it swaps a pointer but instead it swaps the first 8 bytes of your array. To verify this you could use longer strings: And then you get the result you deserve. ;) In case of 32bit addresses you need to make the first 4 bytes of your strings distinguishable. As you can see, there are no swapped pointers at all. Just the start of your arrays is messed up. If you want to swap strings by just swapping pointers, you need to change your array definition: As a side effect you can also drop the casts from your function call as the types now match what is expected. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "1957": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69549917/csv-duplicate-copy-first-row-to-a-table", "CSV duplicate/copy first row to a table I've created an automated job using UC4 where the job is inserting data from one CSV file example.csv to a table example_table.

Your remove_from_cart url path matches paths like cart/<id>/ where id does not have a type so matches anything, the add_to_cart path uses cart/<slug:slug>/ but because any slug will also match id from the previous path this view will ever be used.

You cannot run all goals in the same shell (that cannot work, since the shell must exit after each recipe is complete else make cannot know whether the commands in the recipe were successful or not, and hence whether the rule was successful or not).

You may use the packaged function dbms_sqlhash.gethash as described below, but remember: the package was removed from the documentation (I guess in 11g), so in the recent releases this is an undocumented feature if you calculate the hash code from more than one row you must define order (order by on a unique key(s)) . Otherwise the calculated hash is not deterministic. (This was probaly the reason of the removal) the columns with other data types than varchar2 are converted to strings before the hash calculation, so the result is dependent on the NLS setting.  You must stabilize the NLS setting to get reproducible results, e.g. with alter session set nls_date_format='dd-mm-yyyy hh24:mi:ss'; The column must be concatenated with some special delimiter (that does not occure in the data) to aviod collision: 'A' || null  is the same as null || 'A'. This are unknown internals, so it is rather hard to compare the result MD5 hash with hash calculated on other (non Oracle) data.

[closed] Want to improve this question? Add details and clarify the problem by editing this post. Closed 1 hour ago. Hi can someone please demonstrate how a I can fill and array of type reference with different Object type. I've created the class(triangle,circle,rectangle) for the corresponding object but I cannot figure out a way to have each objects of thoses classes to fill each index of an array I am new to java and I've been stuck on assignment. assignment question: Populate this array randomly with objects that can be of any of the following types:Triangle,Circle,and Rectangle.The state of each object(e.g., position, or radius, etc.) is also randomly assign You can achieve it in a few ways. First one is put your different objects into a collection of raw Object type. For this case you won't need to implement any interface but need to cast the object to your desired type while retrieving from the list. While this approach is simple and works a few time it is not recommended. The other approach would be if you implement a common Shape interface to your all classes and then create a list of Shape. you can then put all your shapes in that collection. You can also invoke common methods of shape that you can  define on the interface while retrieved from the list. You can also make Shape an Abstract class or a Regular Class and use it as a Super class and extend your classes from Shape You can use a factory pattern.

[duplicate] Quote from The C++ standard library: a tutorial and handbook: The only portable way of using templates at the moment is to implement them in header files by using inline functions. Why is this? (Clarification: header files are not the only portable solution. But they are the most convenient portable solution.) Caveat: It is not necessary to put the implementation in the header file, see the alternative solution at the end of this answer. Anyway, the reason your code is failing is that, when instantiating a template, the compiler creates a new class with the given template argument. For example: When reading this line, the compiler will create a new class (let's call it FooInt), which is equivalent to the following: Consequently, the compiler needs to have access to the implementation of the methods, to instantiate them with the template argument (in this case int). If these implementations were not in the header, they wouldn't be accessible, and therefore the compiler wouldn't be able to instantiate the template. A common solution to this is to write the template declaration in a header file, then implement the class in an implementation file (for example .tpp), and include this implementation file at the end of the header. Foo.h Foo.tpp This way, implementation is still separated from declaration, but is accessible to the compiler. Another solution is to keep the implementation separated, and explicitly instantiate all the template instances you'll need: Foo.h Foo.cpp If my explanation isn't clear enough, you can have a look at the C++ Super-FAQ on this subject. It's because of the requirement for separate compilation and because templates are instantiation-style polymorphism. Lets get a little closer to concrete for an explanation. Say I've got the following files: Separate compilation means I should be able to compile foo.cpp independently from bar.cpp. The compiler does all the hard work of analysis, optimization, and code generation on each compilation unit completely independently; we don't need to do whole-program analysis. It's only the linker that needs to handle the entire program at once, and the linker's job is substantially easier. bar.cpp doesn't even need to exist when I compile foo.cpp, but I should still be able to link the foo.o I already had together with the bar.o I've only just produced, without needing to recompile foo.cpp. foo.cpp could even be compiled into a dynamic library, distributed somewhere else without foo.cpp, and linked with code they write years after I wrote foo.cpp. \"Instantiation-style polymorphism\" means that the template MyClass<T> isn't really a generic class that can be compiled to code that can work for any value of T. That would add overhead such as boxing, needing to pass function pointers to allocators and constructors, etc. The intention of C++ templates is to avoid having to write nearly identical class MyClass_int, class MyClass_float, etc, but to still be able to end up with compiled code that is mostly as if we had written each version separately. So a template is literally a template; a class template is not a class, it's a recipe for creating a new class for each T we encounter. A template cannot be compiled into code, only the result of instantiating the template can be compiled. So when foo.cpp is compiled, the compiler can't see bar.cpp to know that MyClass<int> is needed. It can see the template MyClass<T>, but it can't emit code for that (it's a template, not a class). And when bar.cpp is compiled, the compiler can see that it needs to create a MyClass<int>, but it can't see the template MyClass<T> (only its interface in foo.h) so it can't create it. If foo.cpp itself uses MyClass<int>, then code for that will be generated while compiling foo.cpp, so when bar.o is linked to foo.o they can be hooked up and will work. We can use that fact to allow a finite set of template instantiations to be implemented in a .cpp file by writing a single template. But there's no way for bar.cpp to use the template as a template and instantiate it on whatever types it likes; it can only use pre-existing versions of the templated class that the author of foo.cpp thought to provide. You might think that when compiling a template the compiler should \"generate all versions\", with the ones that are never used being filtered out during linking. Aside from the huge overhead and the extreme difficulties such an approach would face because \"type modifier\" features like pointers and arrays allow even just the built-in types to give rise to an infinite number of types, what happens when I now extend my program by adding: There is no possible way that this could work unless we either Nobody likes (1), because whole-program-analysis compilation systems take forever to compile , and because it makes it impossible to distribute compiled libraries without the source code. So we have (2) instead. Plenty correct answers here, but I wanted to add this (for completeness): If you, at the bottom of the implementation cpp file, do explicit instantiation of all the types the template will be used with, the linker will be able to find them as usual. Edit: Adding example of explicit template instantiation. Used after the template has been defined, and all member functions has been defined. This will instantiate (and thus make available to the linker) the class and all its member functions (only). Similar syntax works for function templates, so if you have non-member operator overloads you may need to do the same for those. The above example is fairly useless since vector is fully defined in headers, except when a common include file (precompiled header?) uses extern template class vector<int> so as to keep it from instantiating it in all the other (1000?) files that use vector. Templates need to be instantiated by the compiler before actually compiling them into object code.  This instantiation can only be achieved if the template arguments are known. Now imagine a scenario where a template function is declared in a.h, defined in a.cpp and used in b.cpp. When a.cpp is compiled, it is not necessarily known that the upcoming compilation b.cpp will require an instance of the template, let alone which specific instance would that be. For more header and source files, the situation can quickly get more complicated. One can argue that compilers can be made smarter to \"look ahead\" for all uses of the template, but I'm sure that it wouldn't be difficult to create recursive or otherwise complicated scenarios. AFAIK, compilers don't do such look aheads.  As Anton pointed out, some compilers support explicit export declarations of template instantiations, but not all compilers support it (yet?). Actually, prior to C++11 the standard defined the export keyword that would make it possible to declare templates in a header file and implement them elsewhere. None of the popular compilers implemented this keyword. The only one I know about is the frontend written by the Edison Design Group, which is used by the Comeau C++ compiler. All others required you to write templates in header files, because the compiler needs the template definition for proper instantiation (as others pointed out already). As a result, the ISO C++ standard committee decided to remove the export feature of templates with C++11. Although standard C++ has no such requirement, some compilers require that all function and class templates need to be made available in every translation unit they are used. In effect, for those compilers, the bodies of template functions must be made available in a header file. To repeat: that means those compilers won't allow them to be defined in non-header files such as .cpp files There is an export keyword which is supposed to mitigate this problem, but it's nowhere close to being portable. Templates are often used in headers because the compiler needs to instantiate different versions of the code, depending on the parameters given/deduced for template parameters, and it's easier (as a programmer) to let the compiler recompile the same code multiple times and deduplicate later. Remember that a template doesn't represent code directly, but a template for several versions of that code. When you compile a non-template function in a .cpp file, you are compiling a concrete function/class. This is not the case for templates, which can be instantiated with different types, namely, concrete code must be emitted when replacing template parameters with concrete types. There was a feature with the export keyword that was meant to be used for separate compilation. The export feature is deprecated in C++11 and, AFAIK, only one compiler implemented it. You shouldn't make use of export. Separate compilation is not possible in C++ or C++11 but maybe in C++17, if concepts make it in, we could have some way of separate compilation. For separate compilation to be achieved, separate template body checking must be possible. It seems that a solution is possible with concepts. Take a look at this paper recently presented at the standards committee meeting. I think this is not the only requirement, since you still need to instantiate code for the template code in user code. The separate compilation problem for templates I guess it's also a problem that is arising with the migration to modules, which is currently being worked. EDIT: As of August 2020 Modules are already a reality for C++: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/modules Even though there are plenty of good explanations above, I'm missing a practical way to separate templates into header and body. My main concern is avoiding recompilation of all template users, when I change its definition. Having all template instantiations in the template body is not a viable solution for me, since the template author may not know all if its usage and the template user may not have the right to modify it. I took the following approach, which works also for older compilers (gcc 4.3.4, aCC A.03.13). For each template usage there's a typedef in its own header file (generated from the UML model). Its body contains the instantiation (which ends up in a library which is linked in at the end). Each user of the template includes that header file and uses the typedef. A schematic example: MyTemplate.h: MyTemplate.cpp: MyInstantiatedTemplate.h: MyInstantiatedTemplate.cpp: main.cpp: This way only the template instantiations will need to be recompiled, not all template users (and dependencies). It means that the most portable way to define method implementations of template classes is to define them inside the template class definition. Just to add something noteworthy here. One can define methods of a templated class just fine in the implementation file when they are not function templates. myQueue.hpp: myQueue.cpp: The compiler will generate code for each template instantiation when you use a template during the compilation step.  In the compilation and linking process .cpp files are converted to pure object or machine code which in them contains references or undefined symbols because the .h files that are included in your main.cpp have no implementation YET. These are ready to be linked with another object file that defines an implementation for your template and thus you have a full a.out executable. However since templates need to be processed in the compilation step in order to generate code for each template instantiation that you define, so simply compiling a template separate from it's header file won't work because they always go hand and hand, for the very reason that each template instantiation is a whole new class literally. In a regular class you can separate .h and .cpp because .h is a blueprint of that class and the .cpp is the raw implementation so any implementation files can be compiled and linked regularly, however using templates .h is a blueprint of how the class should look not how the object should look meaning a template .cpp file isn't a raw regular implementation of a class, it's simply a blueprint for a class, so any implementation of a .h template file can't be compiled because you need something concrete to compile, templates are abstract in that sense. Therefore templates are never separately compiled and are only compiled wherever you have a concrete instantiation in some other source file. However, the concrete instantiation needs to know the implementation of the template file, because simply modifying the typename T using a concrete type in the .h file is not going to do the job because what .cpp is there to link, I can't find it later on because remember templates are abstract and can't be compiled, so I'm forced to give the implementation right now so I know what to compile and link, and now that I have the implementation it gets linked into the enclosing source file. Basically, the moment I instantiate a template I need to create a whole new class, and I can't do that if I don't know how that class should look like when using the type I provide unless I make notice to the compiler of the template implementation, so now the compiler can replace T with my type and create a concrete class that's ready to be compiled and linked. To sum up, templates are blueprints for how classes should look, classes are blueprints for how an object should look. I can't compile templates separate from their concrete instantiation because the compiler only compiles concrete types, in other words, templates at least in C++, is pure language abstraction. We have to de-abstract templates so to speak, and we do so by giving them a concrete type to deal with so that our template abstraction can transform into a regular class file and in turn, it can be compiled normally. Separating the template .h file and the template .cpp file is meaningless. It is nonsensical because the separation of .cpp and .h only is only where the .cpp can be compiled individually and linked individually, with templates since we can't compile them separately, because templates are an abstraction, therefore we are always forced to put the abstraction always together with the concrete instantiation where the concrete instantiation always has to know about the type being used. Meaning typename T get's replaced during the compilation step not the linking step so if I try to compile a template without T being replaced as a concrete value type that is completely meaningless to the compiler and as a result object code can't be created because it doesn't know what T is. It is technically possible to create some sort of functionality that will save the template.cpp file and switch out the types when it finds them in other sources, I think that the standard does have a keyword export that will allow you to put templates in a separate cpp file but not that many compilers actually implement this. Just a side note, when making specializations for a template class, you can separate the header from the implementation because a specialization by definition means that I am specializing for a concrete type that can be compiled and linked individually. That is exactly correct because the compiler has to know what type it is for allocation. So template classes, functions, enums,etc.. must be implemented as well in the header file if it is to be made public or part of a library (static or dynamic) because header files are NOT compiled unlike the c/cpp files which are. If the compiler doesn't know the type is can't compile it. In .Net it can because all objects derive from the Object class. This is not .Net. If the concern is the extra compilation time and binary size bloat produced by compiling the .h as part of all the .cpp modules using it, in many cases what you can do is make the template class descend from a non-templatized base class for non type-dependent parts of the interface, and that base class can have its implementation in the .cpp file. A way to have separate implementation is as follows. inner_foo has the forward declarations. foo.tpp has the implementation and include inner_foo.h; and foo.h will have just one line, to include foo.tpp. On compile time, contents of foo.h are copied to foo.tpp and then the whole file is copied to foo.h after which it compiles. This way, there is no limitations, and the naming is consistent, in exchange for one extra file. I do this because static analyzers for the code break when it does not see the forward declarations of class in *.tpp. This is annoying when writing code in any IDE or using YouCompleteMe or others. I suggest looking at this gcc page which discusses the tradeoffs between the \"cfront\" and \"borland\" model for template instantiations. https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.6.4/gcc/Template-Instantiation.html The \"borland\" model corresponds to what the author suggests, providing the full template definition, and having things compiled multiple times. It contains explicit recommendations concerning using manual and automatic template instantiation.  For example, the \"-repo\" option can be used to collect templates which need to be instantiated.  Or another option is to disable automatic template instantiations using \"-fno-implicit-templates\" to force manual template instantiation. In my experience, I rely on the C++ Standard Library and Boost templates being instantiated for each compilation unit (using a template library).  For my large template classes, I do manual template instantiation, once, for the types I need. This is my approach because I am providing a working program, not a template library for use in other programs.  The author of the book, Josuttis, works a lot on template libraries. If I was really worried about speed, I suppose I would explore using Precompiled Headers  https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Precompiled-Headers.html which is gaining support in many compilers.  However, I think precompiled headers would be difficult with template header files. Another reason that it's a good idea to write both declarations and definitions in header files is for readability. Suppose there's such a template function in Utility.h: And in the Utility.cpp: This requires every T class here to implement the less than operator (<). It will throw a compiler error when you compare two class instances that haven't implemented the \"<\". Therefore if you separate the template declaration and definition, you won't be able to only read the header file to see the ins and outs of this template in order to use this API on your own classes, though the compiler will tell you in this case about which operator needs to be overridden. You can actually define your template class inside a .template file rather than a .cpp file. Whoever is saying you can only define it inside a header file is wrong. This is something that works all the way back to c++ 98. Don't forget to have your compiler treat your .template file as a c++ file to keep the intelli sense. Here is an example of this for a dynamic array class. Now inside you .template file you define your functions just how you normally would. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2025": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69549771/how-to-query-this-in-raw-sql", "How to query this in raw SQL?

The problem is in order to add images to the cache I pass in a model(networking) class to the custom UITableViewCell(the view). My understanding is that the View should have no idea of the model. Is this an acceptable design for MVC or is there a way around this? Abstract code is below(using the dictionary as a cache right now.

A cell is a view, and view should never interact with network layers or underlying data models. It's hard to tell what you are doing because your code doesn't compile so I cooked up an example: First you have a class named Model which isn't really a model. It is a service or data provider. You model is DataItem. Here's what my models usually look like: I typically have a service layer that looks like this: The MockDataProvider allows me to inject dummy data for testing without making network calls. Then I would have a service layer that offers services to my viewControllers. In this case, I can fetch any type of object that conforms to Decodable, and I can also fetch images with a caching mechanism. Cells should be kept small, and they should be configured or populated by your view controller: In MVC, a view controller should always be the one to make network calls. As you can see here the view controller makes a network call and then configures the cells. I would recommend using Combine for your network layer as it's much cleaner than using URLSession on it's own with callbacks and such. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2029": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69549766/cloudflare-denies-my-access-when-i-scraped-a-website", "Cloudflare denies my access when I scraped a website I used cloudscraper to scrape this website oddschecker.

First step, I'm trying to make my shell script work. Using VSCode on Windows (I wanted to gain time), I have created a run-nw file at the root of my project, containing this: but I get this output: I really don't understand: Not able to make it work properly, and suspecting something weird with the file itself, I created a new one directly on the Mac, using vim this time. I entered the exact same instructions, and... now it works without any issue. A diff on the two files reveals exactly zero difference. What can be the difference? What can make the first script not work? How can I find out? Following the accepted answer's recommendations, after the wrong line endings came back, I checked multiple things. It turns out that since I copied my ~/.gitconfig from my Windows machine, I had autocrlf=true, so every time I modified the bash file under Windows, it re-set the line endings to \\r\\n. So, in addition to running dos2unix (which you will have to install using Homebrew on a Mac), if you're using Git, check your config. Yes. Bash scripts are sensitive to line-endings, both in the script itself and in data it processes. They should have Unix-style line-endings, i.e., each line is terminated with a Line Feed character (decimal 10, hex 0A in ASCII). With Windows or DOS-style line endings , each line is terminated with a Carriage Return followed by a Line Feed character. You can see this otherwise invisible character in the output of cat -v yourfile: In this case, the carriage return (^M in caret notation or \\r in C escape notation) is not treated as whitespace.  Bash interprets the first line after the shebang (consisting of a single carriage return character) as the name of a command/program to run. Like above, if you have an input file with carriage returns: then it will look completely normal in editors and when writing it to screen, but tools may produce strange results. For example, grep will fail to find lines that are obviously there: Appended text will instead overwrite the line because the carriage returns moves the cursor to the start of the line: String comparison will seem to fail, even though strings appear to be the same when writing to screen: The solution is to convert the file to use Unix-style line endings. There are a number of ways this can be accomplished: This can be done using the dos2unix program: Open the file in a capable text editor (Sublime, Notepad++, not Notepad) and configure it to save files with Unix line endings, e.g., with Vim, run the following command before (re)saving: If you have a version of the sed utility that supports the -i or --in-place option, e.g., GNU sed, you could run the following command to strip trailing carriage returns: With other versions of sed, you could use output redirection to write to a new file. Be sure to use a different filename for the redirection target (it can be renamed later). Similarly, the tr translation filter can be used to delete unwanted characters from its input: With the Bash port for Cygwin, there\u2019s a custom igncr option that can be set to ignore the Carriage Return in line endings (presumably because many of its users use native Windows programs to edit their text files). This can be enabled for the current shell by running set -o igncr. Setting this option applies only to the current shell process so it can be useful when sourcing files with extraneous carriage returns.  If you regularly encounter shell scripts with DOS line endings and want this option to be set permanently, you could set an environment variable called SHELLOPTS (all capital letters) to include igncr. This environment variable is used by Bash to set shell options when it starts (before reading any startup files). The file utility is useful for quickly seeing which line endings are used in a text file. Here\u2019s what it prints for for each file type: The GNU version of the cat utility has a -v, --show-nonprinting option that displays non-printing characters. The dos2unix utility is specifically written for converting text files between Unix, Mac and DOS line endings. Wikipedia has an excellent article covering the many different ways of marking the end of a line of text, the history of such encodings and how newlines are treated in different operating systems, programming languages and Internet protocols (e.g., FTP). With Classic Mac OS (pre-OS X), each line was terminated with a Carriage Return (decimal 13, hex 0D in ASCII). If a script file was saved with such line endings, Bash would only see one long line like so: Since this single long line begins with an octothorpe (#), Bash treats the line (and the whole file) as a single comment. Note: In 2001, Apple launched Mac OS X which was based on the BSD-derived NeXTSTEP operating system. As a result, OS X also uses Unix-style LF-only line endings and since then, text files terminated with a CR have become extremely rare. Nevertheless, I think it\u2019s worthwhile to show how Bash would attempt to interpret such files. On  JetBrains products (PyCharm, PHPStorm, IDEA, etc.),  you'll need to click  on CRLF/LF to toggle between the two types of line separators (\\r\\n and \\n).  If you're using the read command to read from a file (or pipe) that is (or might be) in DOS/Windows format, you can take advantage of the fact that read will trim whitespace from the beginning and ends of lines. If you tell it that carriage returns are whitespace (by adding them to the IFS variable), it'll trim them from the ends of lines. In bash (or zsh or ksh), that means you'd replace this standard idiom: with this: (Note: the -r option isn't related to this, it's just usually a good idea to avoid mangling backslashes.) If you're not using the IFS= prefix (e.g. because you want to split the data into fields), then you'd replace this: with this: If you're using a shell that doesn't support the $'...' quoting mode (e.g. dash, the default /bin/sh on some Linux distros), or your script even might be run with such a shell, then you need to get a little more complex: Note that normally, when you change IFS, you should put it back to normal as soon as possible to avoid weird side effects; but in all these cases, it's a prefix to the read command, so it only affects that one command and doesn't have to be reset afterward. Coming from a duplicate, if the problem is that you have files whose names contain ^M at the end, you can rename them with You properly want to fix whatever caused these files to have broken names in the first place (probably a script which created them should be dos2unixed and then rerun?) but sometimes this is not feasible. The $'\\r' syntax is Bash-specific; if you have a different shell, maybe you need to use some other notation. Perhaps see also Difference between sh and bash One more way to get rid of the unwanted CR ('\\r') character is to run the tr command, for example: I was trying to startup my docker container from Windows and got this: I was using git bash and the problem was about the git config, then I just did the steps below and it worked. It will configure Git to not convert line endings on checkout: Many thanks to Jason Harmon in this link: https://forums.docker.com/t/error-while-running-docker-code-in-powershell/34059/6 Before that, I tried this, that didn't works: I ran into this issue when I use git with WSL. git has a feature where it changes the line-ending of files according to the OS you are using, on Windows it make sure the line endings are \\r\\n which is not compatible with Linux which uses only \\n. You can resolve this problem by adding a file name .gitattributes to your git root directory and add lines as following: In this example all files inside config directory will have only line-feed line ending and run.sh file as well. Since VS Code is being used, we can see CRLF or LF in the bottom right depending on what's being used and if we click on it we can change between them (LF is being used in below example):  We can also use the \"Change End of Line Sequence\" command from the command pallet. Whatever's easier to remember since they're functionally the same. The simplest way on MAC / Linux - create a file using 'touch' command, open this file with VI or VIM editor, paste your code and save. This would automatically remove the windows characters. If you are using a text editor like BBEdit you can do it at the status bar. There is a selection where you can switch.  For the sake of completeness, I'll point out another solution which can solve this problem permanently without the need to run dos2unix all the time: site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2044": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69549742/javascript-giving-me-uncaught-referenceerror-require-is-not-defined-error", "Javascript giving me Uncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined error I have a file structure that looks like this: My index.js has this code My index.html I did not use the tag { type : \"modules } in my package.json.

HTML code: CSS code: Assuming that email is a required input then what is happening is that when the field is not filled in (or doesn't have what looks like a correct email string) on clicking the submit button the form is not submitted, so your code which shows the confetti gets executed. However, if an email is input then on the user clicking the submit button the form gets submitted, so the onclick code never gets executed. I do not know where the form being submitted takes the user. Wherever it is needs to check that an email has been submitted (looking for the email parameter on the URL) and if so then it shows the confetti. This code assumes the submit takes the user back to the same page so it checks whether an email has been submitted each time it's entered. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2055": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69549721/cannot-get-on-reverse-proxy-nginx-socket-io", "Cannot get on reverse proxy nginx socket.io I know there's a similar question to the one I'm asking here, but solutions proposed aren't working with this scenario.

We have an Angular/Ionic app installed on iPhone and Android. The app calls an API on our IIS web server. When the server is up, everything works well. However, while we are deploying a new version of the API website, we would like our app to show a maintenance page. Currently, during the deployment, we create an app_offline.htm file in the API site's root folder, which is the usual way of taking a website offline and showing a maintenance page in IIS. Unfortunately, this means the CORS preflight request from our Ionic app also returns a 503 http error code; I guess that IIS takes the whole site down. We are unable to handle this 503 error in the Angular/Ionic app on the phone, since the preflight request is triggered by the browser. We add custom headers to each request, which cannot be avoided. The net result is that the maintenance page is not displayed when the API site is down. Is there a way to show a maintenance page in our Ionic/Angular app while the API site is being deployed? Perhaps by configuring IIS to allow preflight requests even when app_offline.htm is in place, somehow handling the 503 on the Ionic side, or even stopping the preflight OPTIONS request from the Ionic app? NOTE: I am NOT asking how to configure my site to solve a CORS issue, that part is already in place.

There are many reasons why one might want to use a constructor, but they are optional and depend on what the developer wants to do.

Is there a way to traverse the resulting subset of a set if we use this recursive approach in TypeScript? Thanks. As @DemiPixel mentioned in the comments above, you can use the Generator type as the explicit return type for your function, such as Generator<any[], void, void> which means the generator yields an array of any, returns nothing, and expects nothing to be passed when next() is called.

For example:  The data is stored in a table just like it's stored in the Excel table, that's easy. Now, I'd also like to store style-like information as well in a persistent store, hopefully as a separate table so that I can join it to the data. However, it's a bit tricky, as style comes in four different applications, show in the below picture:  I think a starting approach -- and a very naive approach -- would be to store the data similar to the following: The immediate problem that comes up here is how to join the style to the actual data, especially when it is on the rows-level. One idea is to 'fill-down' columns to rows, but this sounds like a terrible idea, if, for example, the table has a billion rows, and one column has a single style, it would create a billion unnecessary entries. My second thought is to store the row- and cell- data in a joinable way, and store the table- and column- level style in a separate table, which would be applied as a \"base style\" to the table/columns and not actually joined with the. Something like the following: Does this look like a good solution? For example, in the above case we could render the output if, for example, we wrote it to a table as something along the lines of: What could be improved here?

Is it not a byte*? Is there a way to cast it to a byte*? This only happens with a template function, otherwise it works as expected. The error in the first case is because the array buffer does not decay because you have passed it be reference. That is you cannot bind a reference to a pointer to byte to an array of byte. While in the second case b is a pointer which you can pass by reference. Solution 1 One way to solve this is by removing the reference from the function parameter i.e., by the argument by value. So passing by value looks like: Note in solution 1 you can modify the array from inside the function through the pointer. One disadvantage of solution 1 is that here you can also pointer other pointers(like pointer to int) so you have to take care by yourself that you don't try to access anything that is out of bound of the array. Other alternative would be to just pass the array by reference as you originally intended as shown in Solution 2. Solution 2 Pass the array by reference Now in solution 2 you have passed the array by reference and you can modify it directly inside the function template. Now foo<int>(buffer); will work. The issue has nothing to do with templates. Change foo to a non-template void foo(byte* &buffer) and you will see the same error. buffer as declared in the function is of type non-const reference to a pointer to byte. In your second write-up, buffer is of type byte[100] with an l-value category. When assigned to b, decay happens and b is of type byte* with an l-value category. So b can be passed to foo without error. Non-const reference can be bound to a non-const l-value. Your first write-up does not work this way. Two simple fixes. If you prefer, may also declare buffer in foo to be of type non-const reference to byte[100]. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2150": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69549492/is-there-a-technique-whereby-python-can-run-mycode-when-a-class-in-code-that", "Is there a technique whereby Python can run 'mycode()' when a class in code that is not in my control is instantiated So there is a class called ClassInOtherCode in module othercode.py that I cannot alter.

The nginx-prometheus-exporter also comes with a grafana dashboard, you can also give it a try. When Prometheus scrapes an endpoint it expects metrics.

I'm working on a project to implement a distributed key value store in rust.  I've made the server side code using Tokio's asynchronous runtime.  I'm running into an issue where it seems my asynchronous code is blocking so when I have multiple connections to the server only one TcpStream is processed. I'm new to implementing async code, both in general and on rust, but I thought that other streams would be accepted and processed if there was no activity on a given tcp stream. Is my understanding of async wrong or am I using tokio incorrectly? This is my entry point: Below is my handler (handle_stream from the above).  I excluded all the handlers in match input as I didn't think they were necessary to prove the point (full code for that section is here: https://github.com/matthewmturner/Bradfield-Distributed-Systems/blob/main/blue/src/store/handler.rs if it actually helps). Specifically the point that is blocking is the line let input = async_read_message::<message::Request>(&mut stream).await; This is where the server is waiting for communication from either a client or another server in the cluster.  The behavior I currently see is that after connecting to server with client the server doesn't receive any of the requests to add other nodes to the cluster - it only handles the client stream. This is the code for async_read_message Your problem lies with how you're handling messages after clients have connected: This .await means your listening loop will wait for handle_stream to return, but (making some assumptions) this function won't return until the client has disconnected. What you want is to tokio::spawn a new task that can run independently: You may have to change some of your parameter types to avoid lifetimes; tokio::spawn requires 'static since the task's lifetime is decoupled from the scope where it was spawned. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2167": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69549458/digitally-signing-electron-net-application", "Digitally Signing Electron.Net Application Is there a particular process/steps to go through in order to digitally sign the Electron.net app?

Apparently, there's just one value > 0 in columns B to D, so we can exploit the partial rowSums for a replicate call on columns B to D binarized using > 0. So that we can use this in Map, we transpose twice. Rest is cosmetics. Note: R>=4.1 used.

In this code, you are using several packages: express-session, which manages the session itself but delegates how the session is saved to connect-session-sequelize. So the problem is that connect-session-sequelize is trying to save session data in the database, but it cannot because there is no table for sessions. As written in the documentation of this package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-session-sequelize): If you want SequelizeStore to create/sync the database table for you, you can call sync() against an instance of SequelizeStore along with options if needed.

You don't want to use a function(){} for your event handling, because regular functions derive this from the context at runtime, and that context is not your object, but the global context. Using the ancient bind() function (if done right) gets around that, but so does modern arrow function syntax, so use that instead. Done. However, this is silly code and we don't have to do this at all: load your script in the <head> element, as <script src=\"...\" async defer></script>, using the defer attribute so that your script doesn't run until the DOM is ready for queries.

Due to the requirements and limitations of skills, I have to pick up either Flutter or React Native. I have gone through the documents on both platforms, and I see there are some limitations on camera functionalities. (e.g. To my understanding, resolution presets are limited on Flutter, thumbnail image is not generated on React Native by default) https://github.com/flutter/plugins/tree/master/packages/camera/camera https://github.com/react-native-camera/react-native-camera Is there any ways to fully activate the native camera functionalities on Flutter or React Native? If yes, how is it possible? (Maybe it's possible to implement the native functions with Kotlin or Swift inside Flutter or React Native source?) This is my first project for mobile development, so apologies for the lack of understanding both platforms' technologies. My concern is \"how Flutter or React Native camera app would be different from the native code app\". Shooting speed, Burst mode, Zooming function, etc. In Flutter you can use Platform Channels as you said to interract with native code. React native have a similar ability for Native Modules which provides a similar functionality.

More I am diving into documentation of Jest and Its real world use cases. Lesser I am thinking that writing unit test for every other component is not compulsion. Am I missing on something? can someone please guide me here. My idea is when we are using react to create MVP we tend to write a lot of dynamic code. It is of course impossible to test those for all cases because of some compromised design choices. When testing follow the principle of what you are testing. i.e. You do not want to test if react does it's job of batching and updating states. What you may want to test is if the functions are executed and when they are if they result a proper props. React-testing-library has matured enough to support those. Jest is great for your logic functions i.e. when your are deriving some props of a component from a state. You want the props to be what is in your testing boundary. You don't want to count how many times you jest mocks test or spy run. Just imagine it is a controlled console.log where you mat be looking for certain results. Please do not forget about react and it's batching algorithm. I do not think anybody needs to test react and how it works. Just test your props and your state. If it gets too complex snapshot testing may be the way to go. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2209": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69549379/syntaxerror-unexpected-end-of-input-while-building-next-js-vercel-web-app", "`SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input` while building Next.js Vercel web app [closed] Want to improve this question?

How can I tell which way my terminal expects to received data? Should I use fputc, fputwc, or something else? Here is what I've tried with fputc: And with fputwc: With characters.c, the output is consistent with the ASCII characters for the first few items printed on the terminal (!\"#, etc.), then, after ~, it's garbage. I get similar results with wcharacters.c, except that instead of garbage it's ?'s or some other ASCII character (but with the great majority being ?'s). I know the same terminal supports many character representations in in the Unicode code point range 33 to 65535 (decimal), as I can print many of those characters using Python 3. I am using Trisquel GNU/Linux, gcc (-std=c99), and the \"MATE Terminal.\" The font is \"Monospace,\" which sounds generic, but it seems to support many more characters beyond the ASCII range. I am open to using a more recent C standard. At the same time, one of the points of the project I am working on is simplicity, and the C standard seems to become more and more complicated with each successive standard (would using C17's uchar.h be simpler?). With the function I am working on, the user should be able to write any of the graphic characters (as in isgraph) to stdout and have the appearance of those characters be \"correct.\" How can I tell which way my terminal expects to received data? isgraph() OK with narrow characters, not for wide ones. Best to use a restricted range with is...() functions, not [0 ... 65535]. In all cases the argument is an int, the value of which shall be representable as an unsigned char or shall equal the value of the macro EOF. If the argument has any other value, the behavior is undefined.  C17dr \u00a7 7.4 1 is...() is not useful for values outside that range. Aside: for ( wchar_t c = 0 ; c <= 65535 ; c ++ ) risks an infinite loop when wchar_t is 16-bit unsigned. GTG. You could not print the unicode point directly, most terminal only accept UTF8 encoded string by default. How to communicate with C stdout? It is very implementation defined. I am using ... GNU/Linux To communicate with Linux terminal driver, you use ioctls or termios.h libraries. To communicate with the real terminal, you can set the output to be raw and send a special escape sequence, and then you get answer to stdin. For example ESC[6n  request cursor position reports as ESC[#;#R). How can I tell which way my terminal expects to received data? From locale. For example LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 means it wants in UTF-8, LC_ALL=tr_TR.ISO-8859-9 means it wants characters in ISO-8859-9 encoding. Note that from cppreference setlocale: During program startup, the equivalent of setlocale(LC_ALL, \"C\"); is executed before any user code is run. It's typical to do setlocale(LC_ALL, \"\") right after main to use terminal's locale. Should I use fputc, fputwc, or something else? Does not matter, but you should use one of them, once the stream is switched it's hard to switch it back. With fputc you can output the same multibyte characters as wide characters with fputwc, but surely, there may be a situation where there is no multibyte character for wide character. On Linux with UTF-8 locale, with fputc you can output the same UTF-8 code points as with fputwc with UTF-32. GLIBC Extended char intro is a good read. When you use fputwc, behind the scenes glibc converts UTF-32 to locale specific encoding, somewhere about behind here initialized here. It basically calls iconv for each character. after ~, it's garbage. isgraph ( c ) is invalid for c greater than UCHAR_MAX and c different from EOF. #include <wcahr.h> is invalid. I have locale LC_CTYPE=pl_PL.UTF-8. The following program: will output some graphic characters: As mentioned, you can do the same with fputc if you wanna: except that instead of garbage it's ?'s or som Your program is using C locale. C locale can't represent anything other than ASCII. would using C17's uchar.h be simpler? Use wchar_t. It depends on your specific application. In the usual cases, let's trust C standard and C implementations and operating systems and use wchar_t as the \"ultimate\" character. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2212": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69549366/itext-set-up-boder-color-and-width-for-check-box-but-its-not-work", "iText set up boder color and width for check box, but it's not work I want to use iText to add check box to a pdf file, and here is my code: Then here is the result: Actually, as the code showed before, I set up the border color and width, but it just not work, I used Adobe Arcobat and it works: Then I debugged the two file's fields, and I found: As I marked, both the color and width's values are gone, both the values was there just before I call document.close(), I don't know why.

I have tried a few things and searched but no luck. I was hoping there was a to disable modules through typescript.

If the WHERE conditions from the index definition are not very selective, or a somewhat slower execution is also acceptable, you can omit parts of or the whole WHERE clause. That makes the index more widely useful. What is the size of the table and usual query result? The server is usually smart enough and disables indexes, if it expects to return more than the half of the table. Index makes no sense, if the result is rather small. If the server has - let say - 1000 records after several filtration steps, the server stops using indexes. It is cheaper the finish the query using CPU, then loading an index from HDD. As result, indexes are never applied to small tables. Order by is applied at the very end of the query processing. The first field in the index should be one of the fields from the where filter. Boolean fields are seldom useful in the index. It has only two possible values. Index should be created for fields with a lot of different values. Avoid or filtering. It is easy in your case. Put a very big number into number_of_tickets, if the tickets are unlimited. The better index in your case would be just event_id.

The code I am learning is part of a book located at https://dmol.pub/applied/QM9.html (1) (e, x), y = d What you are doing here is essentially unpacking the values from the variable d into the tuple (e, x) and the variable y. This only works if d is in the same format of the left-hand side. For instance, suppose d = ((3, 3), 4). Then: Simpler examples would be: The only difference is that in your example you are using a tuple, thus you need to unpack all values correctly. (2) yhat = atom_count @ w + b The @ operator is an operator used for matrix multiplication, added in Python 3.5. Here you are essentially declaring a variable yhat that is equal to the matrix multiplication of the matrices atom_count and w+b.

Here you are initializing a list called baseline_val_loss with an amount of epochs zeros. If you have epochs = 10, then you would have a python list with 10 zeros. The range function creates a list from 0 to epochs - 1.

This works so long as the text isn't too long. It starts to break at around 7-10k characters text. In order to optimize this I decided to use the VisibilityDetector library because text that isn't visible doesn't need to be colored differently.

I wrote the following simple code and didn't use COMPUTE_FRAME and COMPUTE_MAX deliberately to get myself familiar with the concepts of stack map frame, operand stack, and locals. I only insert three stackmap frame by instrumentation: after the tryEnd label, after the catchStart label, and after the catchEnd (In my class MyMethodVisitor, the code is sho). When I tried my javaagent in the testing process of joda-time, it crashed with the following message: Obviously, it must be the problem when I inserting the stackmap frame. But I got confused: When I looked into the bytecode, it looks like: BTW, my simplified instrumentation code is like: Perhaps the analyze method of the org.objectweb.asm.tree.analysis.Analyzer class will provide us a little insight: Each instruction in the try block will do the following two things: Then, let's simulate the execution of instructions: In the above snippet, the locals[0] at 002 is this; however, the locals[0] at 006 is uninitialized_this. These two values are incompatible. The Current Frame is the actual frame at a specific position, and the Stackmap Frame is the expected frame at another specific position. IMHO, we should not catch the super() method. A few little things: At last, to avoid inconsistency, it is recommended to use the COMPUTE_FRAME options. Let\u2019s clean up first You are creating an exception handler for the entire method, appending the handler after the original code. Assuming that the original code is valid, it must end with a \u2026return, athrow, or goto instruction, as the code is not allowed to \u201cfall off\u201d the end of code. Therefore, the code you\u2019re appending here, the goto over the handler to a newly generated return instruction is unreachable. Unreachable code always requires a new stack map frame to describe its initial state, as the verifier can\u2019t guess one. But, of course, instead of providing a frame for the unreachable code, you can just omit this unnecessary code. So the simplified code looks like Note: since we don\u2019t know what kind of frames the instrumented code contains (e.g. it might introduce new variables), we should not use a frame type defining the stack state based on the previous frame. The example above simply drops all variables, as the exception handler doesn\u2019t need them anyway, which is compatible to every possible stack state\u2014at least for ordinary methods. The code above is sufficient to instrument every ordinary method but not constructors. It is impossible to create an exception handler covering the entire constructor, including the super(\u2026) with stack maps. Older class files without stack maps may install such an exception handler, as long as it doesn\u2019t try to return or to use this. But with stack maps, it\u2019s impossible to express the initial state of the handler: From JVMS\u00a0\u00a74.10.1.9: But if the invocation of an <init> method throws an exception, the uninitialized object might be left in a partially initialized state, and needs to be made permanently unusable. This is represented by an exception frame containing the broken object (the new value of the local) and the flagThisUninit flag (the old flag). There is no way to get from an apparently-initialized object bearing the flagThisUninit flag to a properly initialized object, so the object is permanently unusable. The problem is that we can\u2019t express flags in stack maps. The stack map\u2019s frame only contains types and if UninitializedThis is present, the flag flagThisUninit is assumed to be present, which is suitable to describe the situation before the super constructor invocation. When UninitializedThis is not present, the flag flagThisUninit is assumed to be absent too, which is suitable to describe the situation after the super constructor invocation. But when the super constructor invocation fails with an exception, the stack state is as described above, with the UninitializedThis already replaced by the new value of the local but the flag flagThisUninit still present. We can\u2019t describe such a frame using stack maps, hence, we can\u2019t describe the initial frame of the exception handler. So, you can\u2019t cover the super constructor call with you exception handler. You can only install exception handlers for the code before and after the call and you need two distinct handlers, due to the incompatible flag state. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2286": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69549208/getting-exception-after-migrating-from-java-8-to-11", "Getting exception after migrating from Java 8 to 11 [closed] Want to improve this question?

In domain driven design, should an aggregate keeps redundant data from another aggregate to maintain invariants? For example, if we are designing a system with School and Student aggregate roots, there is a business rule: the total number of students in a school must not exceed 1000 There are two ways to enforce the rule when enrolling a new student to a school: do a select count from Student and check the number against 1000, might need to lock by school id maintain \"student_count\" property in School aggregate, validate the constraint inside the School domain, increment student_count first, then create a new Student. Need to update \"student_count\" property when students are deleted(left school or graduated). Actually I prefer approach 2 as it enforces invariants of School domain, but my colleagues argue that approach 1 is simple to write and maintain. I am looking for more discussions on this subject. Thanks If you are guaranteed that there would be only one client interacting with the service at a time then option 1 would be the simplest check.  The problem with option 1 in a multi-user environment is that pessimistic concurrency lock on the School table whilst the transaction is in process. Option 2 would allow you to retrieve the current count from the database in the School aggregate and then ask the school aggregate to add the student and increment the count before saving back to the database.  At this time, the school aggregate can check the count before adding the student and throw if count is already 1,000. With Option 2 I would implement a concurrency token on the School so that optimistic concurrency can be implemented.  If the school student count has been changed by another process you'll get a DbConcurrencyUpdate exception, which you can handle appropriately. I'd catch that in the application layer and retry on behalf of the client.  If the second time around (or third ...) you are successful, then all good.  If the subsequent time you get a \"Too Many Students\" error then you can then throw back to the client. Option 2 is definitely more DDD compliant - Keep the invariant checking in the school aggregate rather than application layer. For example, if we are designing a system with School and Student aggregate roots, there is a business rule: the total number of students in a school must not exceed 1000 The general term for this problem is set-validation. If \"must not exceed 1000\" is a hard constraint (like: if this ever happens lives will be lost / we can get sued out of existence), then the answer is that the set itself must be completely contained under a single lock, which usually translates to \"the set must be completely contained within one aggregate\". So that might mean that the \"school\" aggregate includes a set of student ids, and that when that set includes 1000 ids then enrollment is closed. It's much more common that set constraints are soft (\"when this happens we make less money\"), in which case we can use discrepancy reports and escalation to trigger the domain processes that bring the set back into compliance. There's been discussion recently on slack:ddd-cqrs-es about the fact that the constraints we use for \"scheduling and planning\" are often stricter than the constraints we use for \"operations\". One key difference to recognize is this: when operating in the real world, the real world is the \"book of record\", our model is just working from a locally cached copy of information that may be wrong or out of date.  We have to be cautious about designs that prevent the real world from correcting our data. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2290": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69549200/swiftui-reduce-number-of-rows-shown-in-a-swiftui-picker", "SwiftUI - Reduce number of rows shown in a SwiftUI Picker Currently the Picker in SwiftUI shows 10 rows of text by default.

There are two ways to apply a style that is placed in the resource to a control. Implicitly. You just need to specify only a TargetType for the Style. Explicitly. You need to specifying a TargetType and an x:Key attribute for the Style. After that, you also need to set the target control's Style property with a {StaticResource} markup extension. In the {StaticResource} markup extension, you could refer to the Style with the x:Key attribute you defined. If a style contains the x:Key attribute, you can only apply it to a control by setting the Style property of the control to the keyed style.

Therefore, if you cast these to an int, the probabilities will all be truncated to 0, although I suspect you're passing the already argmaxed values anyway.

I was given the tip of including a new array (tempIndex, which is currently unused) but did not know how to utilize it nor what needed to be changed within the get() and set() methods. As seen here, the calculations complete but take several minutes. What should I do? You appear to have written a list-like datatype which supports adding adding 'at the back' or adding 'at the front'. The code that adds 'at the back' isn't really the problem. It just sets a single array index, unless the backing array is 'filled to capacity', in which case it makes an array copy. Yes, System.arraycopy is in theory faster, but in practice it usually won't be a particularly noticable difference. Feel free to read up an System.arraycopy and use that instead, but it won't provide a significant speed boost. The code that adds 'at the front', on the other hand, oh boy. That will run a complete loop throughout the entire array every time you invoke it, in order to shift all elements up one slot to make room. Therein lies the problem. That will take longer and longer as the list grows larger and larger. System.arraycopy will not fix that issue. There is a solution, though: RINGS. Instead of envisioning your int[] as a thing with a start and an end, as if it is a line, take that line and bend it so that the ends touch. It's a ring. Consider a new int[100]. Imagine we state that there is neither a start nor an end to this, like a ring. It is not infinite size (it is '100 large'), but, after element 56, there is element 57. After element 99, there is element 0. For this to work, imagine that there is nothing special about 0 or 99. It's just another index, and ALL indexes have a next and previous. You'll need to emulate this ring in your code with some very simplistic math (going 'down' from the 0 should start at length -1, and going 'up' from the length -1 slot should go to 0, but that's all you really need). In your current implementation, you have a backing array of, say, size 150, but your data structure only has length, say, 100. In that case, that array's elements at index 0 through 99 represent the actual elements in the list, and the remaining 50 slots are just there for future use. In the ring, what happens then is that only an arc of the ring is used. In your current implementation, the 'start' of the subrange across your backing array that contains the real data is fixed at 0, and you track the 'end' of the subrange with the length field. The voodoo magic trick here is that, with a ring, and by 'floating' the start, you can now quickly grow from both the front AND the back. To add elements at the back, add them at the right place and increment the 'end of the sublist' marker. To add elements to the front, add them to the right place and decrement the 'front of the sublist' marker. Keep in mind that it's a ring, so 'add 1 to the end marker' may involve turning 99 into 0 if the current backing array capacity is 100. Similarly, 'decrement start-of-segment by 1 and then write this number into that space' may involve 'decrementing 0', which would then mean the index becomes 99. You still need to write the code to create a new larger array and copy all elements over if the backing array runs out of capacity. get(int idx) becomes a little more complicated. For example, if your backing array has 150 elements, 'start' is currently at 140, and 'end' is at 88, then .get(55) means you need to return backingArray[45]. The math is fortunately simple if you know about the modulo operator (%). The module operator is like divide, except it returns the remainder and discards the actual result. So, start + index % backingArray.length is what you want: (140 + 45) % 150 is 45, as you'd want. You'll need to play around with the concept some, and experiment with modulo to write the code in a succint manner. Keep in mind that the aim is to NOT copy the entire array over in either the add-to-the-back or add-to-the-front operation unless the backing array's filled up. The ring solution is how you get there. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2357": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69549045/why-output-is-3-3-1-not-1-2-3", "Why Output is 3 3 1 not 1 2 3?

In my mind, it's simply because the language designers wanted there to be some leeway in the semantics, instead of i.e. requiring that all implementations handle integer overflow in the exact same way, which would very likely impose serious performance costs, they just left the behavior undefined so that if you write code that causes integer overflow, anything can happen. So, with that in mind, why are these \"issues\"? The language clearly says that certain things lead to undefined behavior. There is no problem, there is no \"should\" involved. If the undefined behavior changes when one of the involved variables is declared volatile, that doesn't prove or change anything. It is undefined; you cannot reason about the behavior. Your most interesting-looking example, the one with is a text-book example of undefined behavior (see Wikipedia's entry on sequence points). I think the relevant parts of the C99 standard are 6.5 Expressions, \u00a72 Between the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored value   modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression. Furthermore, the prior value   shall be read only to determine the value to be stored. and 6.5.16 Assignment operators, \u00a74: The order of evaluation of the operands is unspecified. If an attempt is made to modify   the result of an assignment operator or to access it after the next sequence point, the   behavior is undefined. Just compile and disassemble your line of code, if you are so inclined to know how exactly it is you get what you are getting. This is what I get on my machine, together with what I think is going on: (I... suppose that the 0x00000014 instruction was some kind of compiler optimization?) Most of the answers here quoted from C standard emphasizing that the behavior of these constructs are undefined. To understand why the behavior of these constructs are undefined, let's understand these terms first in the light of C11 standard: Sequenced: (5.1.2.3) Given any two evaluations A and B, if A is sequenced before B, then the execution of A shall precede the execution of B. Unsequenced: If A is not sequenced before or after B, then A and B are unsequenced. Evaluations can be one of two things: Sequence Point: The presence of a sequence point between the evaluation of expressions A and B implies that every value computation and side effect associated with A is sequenced before every value computation and side effect associated with B. Now coming to the question, for the expressions like standard says that: If a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either a different side effect on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of the same scalar object, the behavior is undefined. [...] Therefore, the above expression invokes UB because two side effects on the same object i is unsequenced relative to each other. That means it is not sequenced whether the side effect by assignment to i will be done before or after the side effect by ++. Depending on whether assignment occurs before or after the increment, different results will be produced and that's the one of the case of undefined behavior. Lets rename the i at left of assignment be il and at the right of assignment (in the expression i++) be ir, then the expression be like An important point regarding Postfix ++ operator is that: just because the ++ comes after the variable does not mean that the increment happens late. The increment can happen as early as the compiler likes as long as the compiler ensures that the original value is used. It means the expression il = ir++ could be evaluated either as or resulting in two different results 1 and 2 which depends on the sequence of side effects by assignment and ++ and hence invokes UB. The behavior can't really be explained because it invokes both unspecified behavior and undefined behavior, so we can not make any general predictions about this code, although if you read Olve Maudal's work such as Deep C and Unspecified and Undefined sometimes you can make good guesses in very specific cases with a specific compiler and environment but please don't do that anywhere near production. So moving on to unspecified behavior, in draft c99 standard section6.5 paragraph 3 says(emphasis mine): The grouping of operators and operands is indicated by the syntax.74) Except as specified   later (for the function-call (), &&, ||, ?:, and comma operators), the order of evaluation of subexpressions and the order in which side effects take place are both unspecified. So when we have a line like this: we do not know whether i++ or ++i will be evaluated first. This is mainly to give the compiler better options for optimization. We also have undefined behavior here as well since the program is modifying variables(i, u, etc..) more than once between sequence points. From draft standard section 6.5 paragraph 2(emphasis mine): Between the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored value   modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression. Furthermore, the prior value   shall be read only to determine the value to be stored. it cites the following code examples as being undefined: In all these examples the code is attempting to modify an object more than once in the same sequence point, which will end with the ; in each one of these cases: Unspecified behavior is defined in the draft c99 standard in section 3.4.4 as: use of an unspecified value, or other behavior where this International Standard provides   two or more possibilities and imposes no further requirements on which is chosen in any   instance and undefined behavior is defined in section 3.4.3 as: behavior, upon use of a nonportable or erroneous program construct or of erroneous data,   for which this International Standard imposes no requirements and notes that: Possible undefined behavior ranges from ignoring the situation completely with unpredictable results, to behaving during translation or program execution in a documented manner characteristic of the environment (with or without the issuance of a diagnostic message), to terminating a translation or execution (with the issuance of a diagnostic message). Another way of answering this, rather than getting bogged down in arcane details of sequence points and undefined behavior, is simply to ask, what are they supposed to mean? What was the programmer trying to do? The first fragment asked about, i = i++ + ++i, is pretty clearly insane in my book.  No one would ever write it in a real program, it's not obvious what it does, there's no conceivable algorithm someone could have been trying to code that would have resulted in this particular contrived sequence of operations.  And since it's not obvious to you and me what it's supposed to do, it's fine in my book if the compiler can't figure out what it's supposed to do, either. The second fragment, i = i++, is a little easier to understand.  Someone is clearly trying to increment i, and assign the result back to i.  But there are a couple ways of doing this in C.  The most basic way to add 1 to i, and assign the result back to i, is the same in almost any programming language: C, of course, has a handy shortcut: This means, \"add 1 to i, and assign the result back to i\".  So if we construct a hodgepodge of the two, by writing what we're really saying is \"add 1 to i, and assign the result back to i, and assign the result back to i\".  We're confused, so it doesn't bother me too much if the compiler gets confused, too. Realistically, the only time these crazy expressions get written is when people are using them as artificial examples of how ++ is supposed to work.  And of course it is important to understand how ++ works.  But one practical rule for using ++ is, \"If it's not obvious what an expression using ++ means, don't write it.\" We used to spend countless hours on comp.lang.c discussing expressions like these and why they're undefined.  Two of my longer answers, that try to really explain why, are archived on the web: See also question 3.8 and the rest of the questions in section 3 of the C FAQ list. Often this question is linked as a duplicate of questions related to code like or or similar variants. While this is also undefined behaviour as stated already, there are subtle differences when printf() is involved when comparing to a statement such as: In the following statement: the order of evaluation of arguments in printf() is unspecified. That means, expressions i++ and ++i could be evaluated in any order. C11 standard has some relevant descriptions on this: Annex J, unspecified behaviours The order in which the function designator, arguments, and   subexpressions within the arguments are evaluated in a function call   (6.5.2.2). 3.4.4, unspecified behavior Use of an unspecified value, or other behavior where this   International Standard provides two or more possibilities and imposes   no further requirements on which is chosen in any instance. EXAMPLE An example of unspecified behavior is the order in which the   arguments to a function are evaluated. The unspecified behaviour itself is NOT an issue. Consider this example: This too has unspecified behaviour because the order of evaluation of ++x and y++ is unspecified. But it's perfectly legal and valid statement. There's no undefined behaviour in this statement. Because the modifications (++x and y++) are done to distinct objects. What renders the following statement as undefined behaviour is the fact that these two expressions modify the same object i without an intervening sequence point. Another detail is that the comma involved in the printf() call is a separator, not the comma operator. This is an important distinction because the comma operator does introduce a sequence point between the evaluation of their operands, which makes the following legal: The comma operator evaluates its operands left-to-right and yields only the value of the last operand. So in j = (++i, i++);, ++i increments i to 6 and i++ yields old value of i (6) which is assigned to j. Then i becomes 7 due to post-increment. So if the comma in the function call were to be a comma operator then will not be a problem. But it invokes undefined behaviour because the comma here is a separator. For those who are new to undefined behaviour would benefit from reading What Every C Programmer Should Know About Undefined Behavior  to understand the concept and many other variants of undefined behaviour in C. This post: Undefined, unspecified and implementation-defined behavior is also relevant. While it is unlikely that any compilers and processors would actually do so, it would be legal, under the C standard, for the compiler to implement \"i++\" with the sequence: While I don't think any processors support the hardware to allow such a thing to be done efficiently, one can easily imagine situations where such behavior would make multi-threaded code easier (e.g. it would guarantee that if two threads try to perform the above sequence simultaneously, i would get incremented by two) and it's not totally inconceivable that some future processor might provide a feature something like that. If the compiler were to write i++ as indicated above (legal under the standard) and were to intersperse the above instructions throughout the evaluation of the overall expression (also legal), and if it didn't happen to notice that one of the other instructions happened to access i, it would be possible (and legal) for the compiler to generate a sequence of instructions that would deadlock.  To be sure, a compiler would almost certainly detect the problem in the case where the same variable i is used in both places, but if a routine accepts references to two pointers p and q, and uses (*p) and (*q) in the above expression (rather than using i twice) the compiler would not be required to recognize or avoid the deadlock that would occur if the same object's address were passed for both p and q. While the syntax of the expressions like a = a++ or a++ + a++ is legal, the behaviour of these constructs is undefined because a shall in C standard is not obeyed. C99 6.5p2: With footnote 73 further clarifying that This paragraph renders undefined statement expressions such as while allowing The various sequence points are listed in Annex C of C11 (and C99): The following are the sequence points described in 5.1.2.3: The wording of the same paragraph in C11 is: You can detect such errors in a program by for example using a recent version of GCC with -Wall and -Werror, and then GCC will outright refuse to compile your program. The following is the output of gcc (Ubuntu 6.2.0-5ubuntu12) 6.2.0 20161005: The important part is to know what a sequence point is -- and what is a sequence point and what isn't. For example the comma operator is a sequence point, so is well-defined, and will increment i by one, yielding the old value, discard that value; then at comma operator, settle the side effects; and then increment i by one, and the resulting value becomes the value of the expression - i.e. this is just a contrived way to write j = (i += 2) which is yet again a \"clever\" way to write However, the , in function argument lists is not a comma operator, and there is no sequence point between evaluations of distinct arguments; instead their evaluations are unsequenced with regard to each other; so the function call has undefined behaviour because there is no sequence point between the evaluations of i++ and ++i in function arguments, and the value of i is therefore modified twice, by both i++ and ++i, between the previous and the next sequence point. The C standard says that a variable should only be assigned at most once between two sequence points. A semi-colon for instance is a sequence point.  So every statement of the form: and so on violate that rule. The standard also says that behavior is undefined and not unspecified. Some compilers do detect these and produce some result but this is not per standard. However, two different variables can be incremented between two sequence points. The above is a common coding practice while copying/analysing strings. In https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29505280/incrementing-array-index-in-c someone asked about a statement like: which prints 7... the OP expected it to print 6. The ++i increments aren't guaranteed to all complete before the rest of the calculations. In fact, different compilers will get different results here.  In the example you provided, the first 2 ++i executed, then the values of k[] were read, then the last ++i then k[]. Modern compilers will optimize this very well. In fact, possibly better than the code you originally wrote (assuming it had worked the way you had hoped). A good explanation about what happens in this kind of computation is provided in the document n1188 from the ISO W14 site. I explain the ideas. The main rule from the standard ISO 9899 that applies in this situation is  6.5p2. Between the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.   Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value to be stored. The sequence points in an expression like i=i++ are before i= and after i++. In the paper that I quoted above it is explained that you can figure out the program as being formed by small boxes, each box containing the instructions between 2 consecutive sequence points.  The sequence points are defined in annex C of the standard, in the case of i=i++ there are 2 sequence points that delimit a full-expression.  Such an expression is syntactically equivalent with an entry of expression-statement in the Backus-Naur form of the grammar (a grammar is provided in annex A of the Standard). So the order of instructions inside a box has no clear order. can be interpreted as or as because both all these forms to interpret the code i=i++ are valid and because both generate different answers, the behavior is undefined. So a sequence point can be seen by the beginning and the end of each box that composes the program [the boxes are atomic units in C] and inside a box the order of instructions is not defined in all cases.  Changing that order one can change the result sometimes. EDIT: Other good source for explaining such ambiguities are the entries from c-faq site (also published as a book) , namely here and here and here . Your question was probably not, \"Why are these constructs undefined behavior in C?\".  Your question was probably, \"Why did this code (using ++) not give me the value I expected?\", and someone marked your question as a duplicate, and sent you here. This answer tries to answer that question: why did your code not give you the answer you expected, and how can you learn to recognize (and avoid) expressions that will not work as expected. I assume you've heard the basic definition of C's ++ and -- operators by now, and how the prefix form ++x differs from the postfix form x++.  But these operators are hard to think about, so to make sure you understood, perhaps you wrote a tiny little test program involving something like But, to your surprise, this program did not help you understand -- it printed some strange, unexpected, inexplicable output, suggesting that maybe ++ does something completely different, not at all what you thought it did. Or, perhaps you're looking at a hard-to-understand expression like Perhaps someone gave you that code as a puzzle.  This code also makes no sense, especially if you run it -- and if you compile and run it under two different compilers, you're likely to get two different answers!  What's up with that?  Which answer is correct?  (And the answer is that both of them are, or neither of them are.) As you've heard by now, all of these expressions are undefined, which means that the C language makes no guarantee about what they'll do.  This is a strange and surprising result, because you probably thought that any program you could write, as long as it compiled and ran, would generate a unique, well-defined output.  But in the case of undefined behavior, that's not so. What makes an expression undefined?  Are expressions involving ++ and -- always undefined?  Of course not: these are useful operators, and if you use them properly, they're perfectly well-defined. For the expressions we're talking about, what makes them undefined is when there's too much going on at once, when we're not sure what order things will happen in, but when the order matters to the result we get. Let's go back to the two examples I've used in this answer.  When I wrote the question is, before calling actually printf, does the compiler compute the value of x first, or x++, or maybe ++x?  But it turns out we don't know.  There's no rule in C which says that the arguments to a function get evaluated left-to-right, or right-to-left, or in some other order.  So we can't say whether the compiler will do x first, then ++x, then x++, or x++ then ++x then x, or some other order.  But the order clearly matters, because depending on which order the compiler uses, we'll clearly get different results printed by printf. What about this crazy expression? The problem with this expression is that it contains three different attempts to modify the value of x: (1) the x++ part tries to add 1 to x, store the new value in x, and return the old value of x; (2) the ++x part tries to add 1 to x, store the new value in x, and return the new value of x; and (3) the x = part tries to assign the sum of the other two back to x.  Which of those three attempted assignments will \"win\"?  Which of the three values will actually get assigned to x?  Again, and perhaps surprisingly, there's no rule in C to tell us. You might imagine that precedence or associativity or left-to-right evaluation tells you what order things happen in, but they do not.  You may not believe me, but please take my word for it, and I'll say it again: precedence and associativity do not determine every aspect of the evaluation order of an expression in C.  In particular, if within one expression there are multiple different spots where we try to assign a new value to something like x, precedence and associativity do not tell us which of those attempts happens first, or last, or anything. So with all that background and introduction out of the way, if you want to make sure that all your programs are well-defined, which expressions can you write, and which ones can you not write? These expressions are all fine: These expressions are all undefined: And the last question is, how can you tell which expressions are well-defined, and which expressions are undefined? As I said earlier, the undefined expressions are the ones where there's too much going at once, where you can't be sure what order things happen in, and where the order matters: As an example of #1, in the expression there are three attempts to modify `x. As an example of #2, in the expression we both use the value of x, and modify it. So that's the answer: make sure that in any expression you write, each variable is modified at most once, and if a variable is modified, you don't also attempt to use the value of that variable somewhere else. The reason is that the program is running undefined behavior. The problem lies in the evaluation order, because there is no sequence points required according to C++98 standard ( no operations is sequenced before or after another according to C++11 terminology). However if you stick to one compiler, you will find the behavior persistent, as long as you don't add function calls or pointers, which would make the behavior more messy. So first the GCC: Using Nuwen MinGW 15 GCC 7.1 you will get: } How does GCC work? it evaluates sub expressions at a left to right order for the right hand side (RHS) , then assigns the value to the left hand side (LHS) . This is exactly how Java and C# behave and define their standards. (Yes, the equivalent software in Java and C# has defined behaviors). It evaluate each sub expression one by one in the RHS Statement in a left to right order; for each sub expression: the ++c (pre-increment)  is evaluated first then the value c is used for the operation, then the post increment c++). according to GCC C++: Operators In GCC C++,  the precedence of the operators controls the order in   which the individual operators are evaluated the equivalent code in defined behavior C++ as   GCC understands: Then we go to Visual Studio. Visual Studio 2015, you get: How does visual studio work, it takes another approach, it evaluates all pre-increments expressions in first pass, then uses variables values in the operations in second pass,  assign from RHS to LHS in third pass, then at last pass it evaluates all the post-increment expressions in one pass. So the equivalent in defined behavior C++ as Visual C++ understands: as Visual Studio documentation states at Precedence and Order of Evaluation: Where several operators appear together, they have equal precedence and are evaluated according to their associativity. The operators in the table are described in the sections beginning with Postfix Operators. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2358": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69549042/how-do-i-make-a-card-full-width-and-the-image-displayed-besid-even-at-mobile-vie", "How do I make a card full width and the image displayed besid even at mobile view (usig tailwindcss) So I have been trying to display posts to a page using tailwind css cards, at mobile view I still want the cards to be full width and posts images displayed beside just as in desktop view the code example looks like this one below: First of all you need to use media query to modify the tailwind default setting of your card. create a css file and connect it to your html or if you already have it you need to consider few things about screen sizes. write this code in your css file lets understand line by line whats going  on here. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2359": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69549041/sticky-nav-header-with-react-hooks-and-intersectionobserver-api", "Sticky Nav Header with React Hooks and IntersectionObserver API Basically my goal is to translate this StickyNav implementation to ReactJS and keep the cross-browser compatibility: https://codepen.io/smashingmag/pen/XWRXVXQ The main problem I have is to find the proper way to implement the direction and prevYPosition variables with react hooks.

Or as if the first component were superimposed on the second, and when you press the button, it disappears to leave the second below. I tried to figure out how to do this but to no avail.  In pure JS there was a trick.  But here in TS and with Angular I can't find how to do this.

From C11 standard regarding fgets: The fgets function reads at most one less than the number of characters specified by n from the stream pointed to by stream into the array pointed to by s. No additional characters are read after a new-line character (which is retained) or after end-of-file. A null character is written immediately after the last character read into the array. Based on this, the fgets includes the new-line character \\n.  You could correct the code by removing the line feed character.  For example: str[strlen(str) - 1] = \u2018\\0\u2019;. Another thing worth noting is that line scanf(\"%c\", str); writes the first character entered to the array, which is immediately discarded by fgets.

What trade-offs are there for each approach?  When should you choose inheritance over composition? Prefer composition over inheritance as it is more malleable / easy to modify later, but do not use a compose-always approach. With composition, it's easy to change behavior on the fly with Dependency Injection / Setters. Inheritance is more rigid as most languages do not allow you to derive from more than one type. So the goose is more or less cooked once you derive from TypeA. My acid test for the above is: Does TypeB want to expose the complete interface (all public methods no less) of TypeA such that TypeB can be used where TypeA is expected? Indicates Inheritance. Does TypeB want only some/part of the behavior exposed by TypeA? Indicates need for Composition. Update: Just came back to my answer and it seems now that it is incomplete without a specific mention of Barbara Liskov's Liskov Substitution Principle as a test for 'Should I be inheriting from this type?' Think of containment as a has a relationship. A car \"has an\" engine, a person \"has a\" name, etc. Think of inheritance as an is a relationship. A car \"is a\" vehicle, a person \"is a\" mammal, etc. I take no credit for this approach. I took it straight from the Second Edition of Code Complete by Steve McConnell, Section 6.3. If you understand the difference, it's easier to explain. An example of this is PHP without the use of classes (particularly before PHP5). All logic is encoded in a set of functions. You may include other files containing helper functions and so on and conduct your business logic by passing data around in functions. This can be very hard to manage as the application grows. PHP5 tries to remedy this by offering more object oriented design. This encourages the use of classes. Inheritance is one of the three tenets of OO design (inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation). This is inheritance at work. The Employee \"is a\" Person or inherits from Person. All inheritance relationships are \"is-a\" relationships. Employee also shadows the Title property from Person, meaning Employee.Title will return the Title for the Employee not the Person. Composition is favoured over inheritance. To put it very simply you would have: Composition is typically \"has a\" or \"uses a\" relationship. Here the Employee class has a Person. It does not inherit from Person but instead gets the Person object passed to it, which is why it \"has a\" Person. Now say you want to create a Manager type so you end up with: This example will work fine, however, what if Person and Employee both declared Title? Should Manager.Title return \"Manager of Operations\" or \"Mr.\"? Under composition this ambiguity is better handled: The Manager object is composed as an Employee and a Person. The Title behaviour is taken from employee. This explicit composition removes ambiguity among other things and you'll encounter fewer bugs. With all the undeniable benefits provided by inheritance, here's some of its disadvantages. Disadvantages of Inheritance: On the other hand Object composition is defined at runtime through objects acquiring references to other objects. In such a case these objects will never be able to reach each-other's protected data (no encapsulation break) and will be forced to respect each other's interface. And in this case also, implementation dependencies will be a lot less than in case of inheritance. Another, very pragmatic reason, to prefer composition over inheritance has to do with your domain model, and mapping it to a relational database. It's really hard to map inheritance to the SQL model (you end up with all sorts of hacky workarounds, like creating columns that aren't always used, using views, etc). Some ORMLs try to deal with this, but it always gets complicated quickly. Composition can be easily modeled through a foreign-key relationship between two tables, but inheritance is much harder. While in short words I would agree with \"Prefer composition over inheritance\", very often for me it sounds like \"prefer potatoes over coca-cola\". There are places for inheritance and places for composition. You need to understand difference, then this question will disappear. What it really means for me is \"if you are going to use inheritance - think again, chances are you need composition\". You should prefer potatoes over coca cola when you want to eat, and coca cola over potatoes when you want to drink. Creating a subclass should mean more than just a convenient way to call superclass methods. You should use inheritance when subclass \"is-a\" super class both structurally and functionally, when it can be used as superclass and you are going to use that. If it is not the case - it is not inheritance, but something else. Composition is when your objects consists of another, or has some relationship to them. So for me it looks like if someone does not know if he needs inheritance or composition, the real problem is that he does not know if he want to drink or to eat. Think about your problem domain more, understand it better. Inheritance is pretty enticing especially coming from procedural-land and it often looks deceptively elegant. I mean all I need to do is add this one bit of functionality to some other class, right? Well, one of the problems is that Your base class breaks encapsulation by exposing implementation details to subclasses in the form of protected members. This makes your system rigid and fragile. The more tragic flaw however is the new subclass brings with it all the baggage and opinion of the inheritance chain. The article, Inheritance is Evil: The Epic Fail of the DataAnnotationsModelBinder, walks through an example of this in C#. It shows the use of inheritance when composition should have been used and how it could be refactored. Didn't find a satisfactory answer here, so I wrote a new one. To understand why \"prefer composition over inheritance\", we need first get back the assumption omitted in this shortened idiom. There are two benefits of inheritance: subtyping and subclassing Subtyping means conforming to a type (interface) signature, i.e. a set of APIs, and one can override part of the signature to achieve subtyping polymorphism. Subclassing means implicit reuse of method implementations. With the two benefits comes two different purposes for doing inheritance: subtyping oriented and code reuse oriented. If code reuse is the sole purpose, subclassing may give one more than what he needs, i.e. some public methods of the parent class don't make much sense for the child class. In this case, instead of favoring composition over inheritance, composition is demanded. This is also where the \"is-a\" vs. \"has-a\" notion comes from. So only when subtyping is purposed, i.e. to use the new class later in a polymorphic manner, do we face the problem of choosing inheritance or composition. This is the assumption that gets omitted in the shortened idiom under discussion. To subtype is to conform to a type signature, this means composition has always to expose no less amount of APIs of the type. Now the trade offs kick in: Inheritance provides straightforward code reuse if not overridden, while composition has to re-code every API, even if it's just a simple job of delegation. Inheritance provides straightforward open recursion via the internal polymorphic site this, i.e. invoking overriding method (or even type) in another member function, either public or private (though discouraged). Open recursion can be simulated via composition, but it requires extra effort and may not always viable(?). This answer to a duplicated question talks something similar. Inheritance exposes protected members. This breaks encapsulation of the parent class, and if used by subclass, another dependency between the child and its parent is introduced. Composition has the befit of inversion of control, and its dependency can be injected dynamically, as is shown in decorator pattern and proxy pattern. Composition has the benefit of combinator-oriented programming, i.e. working in a way like the composite pattern. Composition immediately follows programming to an interface. Composition has the benefit of easy multiple inheritance. With the above trade offs in mind, we hence prefer composition over inheritance. Yet for tightly related classes, i.e. when implicit code reuse really make benefits, or the magic power of open recursion is desired, inheritance shall be the choice. In Java or C#, an object cannot change its type once it has been instantiated. So, if your object need to appear as a different object or behave differently depending on an object state or conditions, then use Composition: Refer to State and Strategy Design Patterns. If the object need to be of the same type, then use Inheritance or implement interfaces. You can always use composition. In some cases, inheritance is also possible and may lead to a more powerful and/or intuitive API, but composition is always an option. It is often said that if \"a bar is a foo\", then the class Bar can inherit the class Foo. Unfortunately, this test alone is not reliable, use the following instead: The first test ensures that all getters of Foo make sense in Bar (= shared properties), while the second test makes sure that all setters of Foo make sense in Bar (= shared functionality). Example: Dog/Animal A dog is an animal AND dogs can do everything that animals can do (such as breathing, moving, etc.). Therefore, the class Dog can inherit the class Animal. Counter-example: Circle/Ellipse A circle is an ellipse BUT circles can't do everything that ellipses can do. For example, circles can't stretch, while ellipses can. Therefore, the class Circle cannot inherit the class Ellipse. This is called the Circle-Ellipse problem, which isn't really a problem, but more an indication that \"a bar is a foo\" isn't a reliable test by itself. In particular, this example highlights that derived classes should extend the functionality of base classes, never restrict it. Otherwise, the base class couldn't be used polymorphically. Adding the test \"bars can do everything that foos can do\" ensures that polymorphic use is possible, and is equivalent to the Liskov Substitution Principle: Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it Even if you can use inheritance doesn't mean you should: using composition is always an option. Inheritance is a powerful tool allowing implicit code reuse and dynamic dispatch, but it does come with a few disadvantages, which is why composition is often preferred. The trade-offs between inheritance and composition aren't obvious, and in my opinion are best explained in lcn's answer. As a rule of thumb, I tend to choose inheritance over composition when polymorphic use is expected to be very common, in which case the power of dynamic dispatch can lead to a much more readable and elegant API. For example, having a polymorphic class Widget in GUI frameworks, or a polymorphic class Node in XML libraries allows to have an API which is much more readable and intuitive to use than what you would have with a solution purely based on composition. Personally I learned to always prefer composition over inheritance. There is no programmatic problem you can solve with inheritance which you cannot solve with composition; though you may have to use Interfaces(Java) or Protocols(Obj-C) in some cases. Since C++ doesn't know any such thing, you'll have to use abstract base classes, which means you cannot get entirely rid of inheritance in C++. Composition is often more logical, it provides better abstraction, better encapsulation, better code reuse (especially in very large projects) and is less likely to break anything at a distance just because you made an isolated change anywhere in your code. It also makes it easier to uphold the \"Single Responsibility Principle\", which is often summarized as \"There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.\", and it means that every class exists for a specific purpose and it should only have methods that are directly related to its purpose. Also having a very shallow inheritance tree makes it much easier to keep the overview even when your project starts to get really large. Many people think that inheritance represents our real world pretty well, but that isn't the truth. The real world uses much more composition than inheritance. Pretty much every real world object you can hold in your hand has been composed out of other, smaller real world objects. There are downsides of composition, though. If you skip inheritance altogether and only focus on composition, you will notice that you often have to write a couple of extra code lines that weren't necessary if you had used inheritance. You are also sometimes forced to repeat yourself and this violates the DRY Principle (DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself). Also composition often requires delegation, and a method is just calling another method of another object with no other code surrounding this call. Such \"double method calls\" (which may easily extend to triple or quadruple method calls and even farther than that) have much worse performance than inheritance, where you simply inherit a method of your parent. Calling an inherited method may be equally fast as calling a non-inherited one, or it may be slightly slower, but is usually still faster than two consecutive method calls. You may have noticed that most OO languages don't allow multiple inheritance. While there are a couple of cases where multiple inheritance can really buy you something, but those are rather exceptions than the rule. Whenever you run into a situation where you think \"multiple inheritance would be a really cool feature to solve this problem\", you are usually at a point where you should re-think inheritance altogether, since even it may require a couple of extra code lines, a solution based on composition will usually turn out to be much more elegant, flexible and future proof. Inheritance is really a cool feature, but I'm afraid it has been overused the last couple of years. People treated inheritance as the one hammer that can nail it all, regardless if it was actually a nail, a screw, or maybe a something completely different. My general rule of thumb: Before using inheritance, consider if composition makes more sense. Reason: Subclassing usually means more complexity and connectedness, i.e. harder to change, maintain, and scale without making mistakes. A much more complete and concrete answer from Tim Boudreau of Sun: Common problems to the use of inheritance as I see it are: ... My take on what to do, if you do allow for inheritance, which you may   take with a grain of salt is: ... all of this applies less to small projects than large ones, and less   to private classes than public ones Inheritance is very powerful, but you can't force it (see: the circle-ellipse problem). If you really can't be completely sure of a true \"is-a\" subtype relationship, then it's best to go with composition. Inheritance creates a strong relationship between a subclass and super class; subclass must be aware of super class'es implementation details. Creating the super class is much harder, when you have to think about how it can be extended. You have to document class invariants carefully, and state what other methods overridable methods use internally. Inheritance is sometimes useful, if the hierarchy really represents a is-a-relationship. It relates to Open-Closed Principle, which states that classes should be closed for modification but open to extension. That way you can have polymorphism; to have a generic method that deals with super type and its methods, but via dynamic dispatch the method of subclass is invoked. This is flexible, and helps to create indirection, which is essential in software (to know less about implementation details). Inheritance is easily overused, though, and creates additional complexity, with hard dependencies between classes. Also understanding what happens during execution of a program gets pretty hard due to layers and dynamic selection of method calls. I would suggest using composing as the default. It is more modular, and gives the benefit of late binding (you can change the component dynamically). Also it's easier to test the things separately. And if you need to use a method from a class, you are not forced to be of certain form (Liskov Substitution Principle). Suppose an aircraft has only two parts: an engine and wings. Then there are two ways to design an aircraft class. Now your aircraft can start with having fixed wings and change them to rotary wings on the fly. It's essentially an engine with wings. But what if I wanted to change the engine on the fly as well? Either the base class Engine exposes a mutator to change its properties, or I redesign Aircraft as: Now, I can replace my engine on the fly as well. You need to have a look at The Liskov Substitution Principle in Uncle Bob's SOLID principles of class design. :) When you want to \"copy\"/Expose the base class' API, you use inheritance. When you only want to \"copy\" functionality, use delegation. One example of this: You want to create a Stack out of a List. Stack only has pop, push and peek. You shouldn't use inheritance given that you don't want push_back, push_front, removeAt, et al.-kind of functionality in a Stack. To address this question from a different perspective for newer programmers: Inheritance is often taught early when we learn object-oriented programming, so it's seen as an easy solution to a common problem. I have three classes that all need some common functionality. So if I   write a base class and have them all inherit from it, then they will   all have that functionality and I'll only need to maintain it in once   place. It sounds great, but in practice it almost never, ever works, for one of several reasons: In the end, we tie our code in some difficult knots and get no benefit whatsoever from it except that we get to say, \"Cool, I learned about inheritance and now I used it.\" That's not meant to be condescending because we've all done it. But we all did it because no one told us not to. As soon as someone explained \"favor composition over inheritance\" to me, I thought back over every time I tried to share functionality between classes using inheritance and realized that most of the time it didn't really work well. The antidote is the Single Responsibility Principle. Think of it as a constraint. My class must do one thing. I must be able to give my class a name that somehow describes that one thing it does. (There are exceptions to everything, but absolute rules are sometimes better when we're learning.) It follows that I cannot write a base class called ObjectBaseThatContainsVariousFunctionsNeededByDifferentClasses. Whatever distinct functionality I need must be in its own class, and then other classes that need that functionality can depend on that class, not inherit from it. At the risk of oversimplifying, that's composition - composing multiple classes to work together. And once we form that habit we find that it's much more flexible, maintainable, and testable than using inheritance. These two ways can live together just fine and actually support each other. Composition is just playing it modular: you create interface similar to the parent class, create new object and delegate calls to it. If these objects need not to know of each other, it's quite safe and easy to use composition. There are so many possibilites here. However, if the parent class for some reason needs to access functions provided by the \"child class\" for inexperienced programmer it may look like it's a great place to use  inheritance. The parent class can just call it's own abstract \"foo()\" which is overwritten by the subclass and then it can give the value to the abstract base. It looks like a nice idea, but in many cases it's better just give the class an object which implements the foo() (or even set the value provided the foo() manually) than to inherit the new class from some base class which requires the function foo() to be specified. Why? Because inheritance is a poor way of moving information. The composition has a real edge here: the relationship can be reversed: the \"parent class\" or \"abstract worker\" can aggregate any specific \"child\" objects implementing certain interface + any child can be set inside any other type of parent, which accepts it's type. And there can be any number of objects, for example MergeSort or QuickSort could sort any list of objects implementing an abstract Compare -interface. Or to put it another way: any group of objects which implement \"foo()\" and other group of objects which can make use of objects having \"foo()\" can play together. I can think of three real reasons for using inheritance: If these are true, then it is probably necessary to use inheritance. There is nothing bad in using reason 1, it is very good thing to have a solid interface on your objects. This can be done using composition or with inheritance, no problem - if this interface is simple and does not change. Usually inheritance is quite effective here. If the reason is number 2 it gets a bit tricky. Do you really only need to use the same base class? In general, just using the same base class is not good enough, but it may be a requirement of your framework, a design consideration which can not be avoided. However, if you want to use the private variables, the case 3, then you may be in trouble. If you consider global variables unsafe, then you should consider using inheritance to get access to private variables also unsafe. Mind you, global variables are not all THAT bad - databases are essentially big set of global variables. But if you can handle it, then it's quite fine. Aside from is a/has a considerations, one must also consider the \"depth\" of inheritance your object has to go through. Anything beyond five or six levels of inheritance deep might cause unexpected casting and boxing/unboxing problems, and in those cases it might be wise to compose your object instead. When you have an is-a relation between two classes (example dog is a canine), you go for inheritance. On the other hand when you have has-a or some adjective relationship between two classes (student has courses) or (teacher studies courses), you chose composition. A simple way to make sense of this would be that inheritance should be used when you need an object of your class to have the same interface as its parent class, so that it can thereby be treated as an object of the parent class (upcasting). Moreover, function calls on a derived class object would remain the same everywhere in code, but the specific method to call would be determined at runtime (i.e. the low-level implementation differs, the high-level interface remains the same). Composition should be used when you do not need the new class to have the same interface, i.e. you wish to conceal certain aspects of the class' implementation which the user of that class need not know about. So composition is more in the way of supporting encapsulation (i.e. concealing the implementation) while inheritance is meant to support abstraction (i.e. providing a simplified representation of something, in this case the same interface for a range of types with different internals). Subtyping is appropriate and more powerful where the invariants can be enumerated, else use function composition for extensibility. I agree with @Pavel, when he says, there are places for composition and there are places for inheritance. I think inheritance should be used if your answer is an affirmative to any of these questions. However, if your intention is purely that of code re-use, then composition most likely is a better design choice. Inheritance is a very powerfull machanism for code reuse. But needs to be used properly. I would say that inheritance is used correctly if the subclass is also a subtype of the parent class. As mentioned above, the Liskov Substitution Principle is the key point here. Subclass is not the same as subtype. You might create subclasses that are not subtypes (and this is when you should use composition). To understand what a subtype is, lets start giving an explanation of what a type is. When we say that the number 5 is of type integer, we are stating that 5 belongs to a set of possible values (as an example, see the possible values for the Java primitive types). We are also stating that there is a valid set of methods I can perform on the value like addition and subtraction. And finally we are stating that there are a set of properties that are always satisfied, for example, if I add the values 3 and 5, I will get 8 as a result. To give another example, think about the abstract data types, Set of integers and List of integers, the values they can hold are restricted to integers. They both support a set of methods, like add(newValue) and size(). And they both have different properties (class invariant), Sets does not allow duplicates while List does allow duplicates (of course there are other properties that they both satisfy). Subtype is also a type, which has a relation to another type, called parent type (or supertype). The subtype must satisfy the features (values, methods and properties) of the parent type. The relation means that in any context where the supertype is expected, it can be substitutable by a subtype, without affecting the behaviour of the execution. Let\u2019s go to see some code to exemplify what I\u2019m saying. Suppose I write a List of integers (in some sort of pseudo language): Then, I write the Set of integers as a subclass of the List of integers: Our Set of integers class is a subclass of List of Integers, but is not a subtype, due to it is not satisfying all the features of the List class. The values, and the signature of the methods are satisfied but the properties are not. The behaviour of the add(Integer) method has been clearly changed, not preserving the properties of the parent type. Think from the point of view of the client of your classes. They might receive a Set of integers where a List of integers is expected. The client might want to add a value and get that value added to the List even if that value already exist in the List. But her wont get that behaviour if the value exists. A big suprise for her! This is a classic example of an improper use of inheritance. Use composition in this case. (a fragment from: use inheritance properly). A rule of thumb I have heard is inheritance should be used when its a \"is-a\" relationship and composition when its a \"has-a\". Even with that I feel that you should always lean towards composition because it eliminates a lot of complexity. Even though Composition is preferred, I would like to highlight pros of Inheritance and cons of Composition. Pros of Inheritance: It establishes a logical \"IS A\" relation. If Car and Truck are two types of Vehicle ( base class), child class IS A base class. i.e. Car is a Vehicle Truck is a Vehicle With inheritance, you can define/modify/extend a capability Cons of Composition: e.g. If  Car contains Vehicle and if you have to get price of the Car, which has been defined in Vehicle, your code will be like this Composition v/s Inheritance is a wide subject. There is no real answer for what is better as I think it all depends on the design of the system. Generally type of relationship between object provide better information to choose one of them. If relation type is  \"IS-A\" relation then Inheritance is better approach. otherwise relation type is  \"HAS-A\" relation then composition will better approach. Its totally depend on entity relationship. I see no one mentioned the diamond problem, which might arise with inheritance. In a glance, if classes B and C inherit A and both override method X, and a fourth class D, inherits from both B and C, and does not override X, which implementation of X D is supposed to use? Wikipedia offers a nice overview of the topic being discussed in this question. As many people told, I will first start with the check - whether there exists an \"is-a\" relationship. If it exists I usually check the following: Whether the base class can be instantiated. That is, whether the base class can be non-abstract.  If it can be non-abstract I usually prefer composition E.g 1. Accountant is an Employee. But I will not use inheritance because a Employee object can be instantiated. E.g 2. Book is a SellingItem. A SellingItem cannot be instantiated - it is abstract concept. Hence I will use inheritacne. The SellingItem is an abstract base class (or interface in C#) What do you think about this approach? Also, I support @anon answer in Why use inheritance at all? The main reason for using inheritance is not as a form of composition - it is so you can get polymorphic behaviour. If you don't need polymorphism, you probably should not be using inheritance. @MatthieuM. says in https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/12439/code-smell-inheritance-abuse/12448#comment303759_12448 The issue with inheritance is that it can be used for two orthogonal purposes: interface (for polymorphism) implementation (for code reuse) REFERENCE site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2397": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69548954/how-to-solve-sql-invalid-identifier-to-date-function", "How to solve sql invalid identifier to date function [closed] Want to improve this question?

Eg - I am accessing my data from eu-west-2 from ap-southeast-2 with transfer acceleration enabled. If I make a few calls in a row, (3 or 4 calls, within 3-5 seconds). My logged GetObjectAsync times will look something like: What is happening after these initial 3-4 calls that then enables super fast access and is there anyway I can make the latter calls the status quo? In this case I am getting the data from a vast distance, but the same thing happens if I access my local machine which is on the same continent (AU). My GetObjectAsync call response timings might then look like: So it appears symptomatic of same, just obviously with reduced latency all round due to geography. If I then stop making calls for a few minutes again, it \"resets\" and starts from the high latency again. I'm very latency sensitive so need it to perform at the lower end, always.

I get my S3 file via the following code: You're using _s3.GetObjectAsync(...), which is much better than _s3.GetObject as it's asynchronous, but then you're using reader.ReadToEnd(); which is synchronous and blocking. The reason why it speeds up is not AWS related as you've proven by running the code from various locations but also the fact that Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration works by essentially \"caching\" your data at Edge Locations. I would assume that your application is speeding up due to some form of StreamReader object caching by the .NET CLR but that could only be proven by seeing the specific timing outputs that you've mentioned in your code. Regardless, I would stick with either synchronous or asynchronous, preferably the latter so that would be reading from the stream using StreamReader.ReadToEndAsync. This should produce consistent results: Also, if you're reading to eventually write to a file, it's good to be aware of  GetObjectResponse.WriteResponseStreamToFileAsync which will encapsulate this logic for you. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2400": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69548944/how-do-you-correctly-store-an-httponly-cookie-containing-a-refresh-token-in-the", "How do you correctly store an httponly cookie containing a refresh token in the client? I have been reading up on the topic of securing an API using doorkeeper. For the most part it has been pretty straight forward to set up the access token, refresh token pair. The issue I am currently having is what to do with the refresh token. The approach that appears to be most popular (from the posts that I have read on the topic) is to store the refresh token in an httponly cookie and place it in local storage. I understand setting the httponly cookie on the server side prior to making a request, I do not understand how to store that cookie in local storage. I must be misunderstanding something, because for starters it seem counter intuitive to use JavaScript to store a piece of data that has no JavaScript API to manipulate it.

So I am using Centos 8 Stream starting from minimal install and I have built a functioning MediaWiki v1.35.4 accessible within my local network with httpd(apache). I am trying to utilize SyntaxHighlight, but it is being treated as if I just put  tags around the code.  It is behaving as though I have left out all parameters.  I have triple-checked and verified that my syntax is correct on the parameters and I am able to get SyntaxHighlight to work on a Mac with a locally hosted apache server. I have tried enabling execute permissions on the pygmantize file within the SyntaxHighlight extension folder as well as enabling execute permissions on ALL files withing the extension folder and saw no difference in the result.  I have also tried installing pygments outside of MediaWiki without success (which also required a python installation that did not make a difference).

I will just code not play, so I will scale down game graphics completely, so everything will be fine.

I add VBoxGuestAdditions 6.1.26 to the VM and install it to access this share files. After the restart on my Windows 10 Desktop there is a kind of a \"graphical error\". I installed the game anyway and try to start it but there was an critical error with DirectX :(. I installed the game as I described above before on a VM with different settings which grant less  system performance and it worked with ~5 fps in game.

The working code I have properly (I hope) creates the VBO, binds it to the VAO, and passes the vertex data in order for it to be displayed: My code produces a rotating, white cube, but I don't fully grasp how the gl calls are interfacing with each other, and as such I dont know exactly how I would integrate a second buffer object into the VAO or if thats even what I should be intending to do. From the gl documentation, I believe I need to enable the GL_COLOR_ARRAY, create another buffer object (would it still be called a VBO?), bind that object to the VAO, pass along the color data, and define the array of color data using glColorPointer. But as to the order of those in relation to the existing code for vertex_Data as well as when/if I am unbinding, I am at a loss. Any help or insight would be appreciated. Create an array buffer like you do for the vertices: Define the array of color attributes with glColorPointer and enable the client state: OpenGL is a state engine. A state is kept util it is changed again. The current array buffer binding is a global state (which is set with glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, object)). If you specify an array with glVertexPointer or glColorPointer, the corresponding buffer object must be bound. When this instructions are called, the buffer which is currently bound to the GL_ARRAY_BUFFER target is associated to the fixed function attribute (vertex respectively color). site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2429": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69548885/application-logging-not-following-the-logging-pattern-level-after-springboot-ver", "Application logging not following the logging.pattern.level after springboot version upgrade After updating the sprinboot version I started getting the following error at the beginning of the app and the logs are not following the logging.pattern.level from the application.properties The pattern is as follows: There has been a change in syntax in the newer versions (2.3.5+) replace () with {} as follows and see if this helps: site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2430": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69548883/erc721-licensing", "ERC721 Licensing?

Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post. Closed 10 hours ago. I had some theoretical thoughts today and it's not something I've ever done before. I have an existing software application which is essentially an industry specific ERP-type application originally developed in the '80s. It provides point of sale, accounting, inventory, payroll, and a bunch of other things. Imagine the software you saw running on a cash register at a Montgomery Wards or Sears in the '90s. It was originally developed for HP-Unix but is now virtualized running in a CentOS container and we access it using terminal emulation on modern hardware. One thing it provides is to print price tags. These are printed on industry specific media with a thermal printer. Basically a barcode, price, product name, sku, etc. When a user prints a batch of tags and sends it, there are no print dialogs, no driver configuration settings, it just prints. While I haven't dug into the code for this yet (I have a very basic understand of how it works, it's ancient and pretty obscure) I assume that it has all the formatting and everything hard coded and sends the printer raw PCL commands or something along those lines. I am thinking of attempting to build a replacement tool for printing these tags using the same hardware and media, but having it be browser based and hosted on the internal network and firewalled from the outside world. So the question is How do I print directly to this local network printer from a browser? I'm guessing the procedure would follow something such as: As I have never worked with printers in this capacity before, I will have to learn some PCL and other related bits I am sure. Are there modern libraries out there that would ease this and provide features that would make it easier to port these print commands from one printer to another?

I want to push this down using intune to azure laptops. But it gives me an error on the device: ps I suck at this and these will run on azure enrolled devices if that helps. Quick and dirty: You can do a partial match of the group members, but remember they're distinguishedNames - in my environment, if we tried to match $env:username, it'd fail. Alternatively, if your groups are huge and/or you have a lot of network latency, another way of doing this is to actually check the user's group memberships on the local machine, rather than parsing through all group members that you're dragging down from AD. You can crack open the user's Kerberos token to list their AD group memberships with [System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent() Then, you can embed your group's SID into your script to match with the token's group list or you could futureproof it by checking the group SID in ADSI. This is an excellent article that demonstrates this method to check group SIDs via the Kerberos token - since we have a known group, the scenario is a bit simpler: https://activedirectoryfaq.com/2016/08/read-kerberos-token-powershell/ It's worth trying both options with a Measure-Command to see which might be more efficient in your scenario. The question is what you really need. Using the PS module is probably the easiest. You could use a remote session for this as well (depending on what those notebooks can do and what access they got). As far as I can see from your code you're really only interested in whenver a person is a member of a specific group. Depending on what you do you could use a LDAP query for the user itself rather than grabbing every user of those groups to do this. There are other tools that can help you out as well, for instance whoami /groups. Another option might be to use net user username /DOMAIN. Using whoami is pretty easy from PS. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2445": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69548862/visual-studio-code-sass-compiler-each-not-supported", "Visual Studio Code - Sass Compiler - @each not supported I'm trying to get my sass (with @each) compiled into css.

I made a 'database.sql' page in VS Code already, but I'm not sure how and where to link it to my main code. Its better to manually enter a table in MySql and not in code, just maintain database.sql file which you can maintain in your repo MySQL's CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS has existed for quite a while. Use this either in a SQL file, and/or somewhere in the initialization part of your code. If you've manually created the right structure in Workbench, grab the output from show create table sessions and you'll have a reproducible structure. The advantage of SQL is its structured nature, so it shouldn't be too much a a surprise that tables aren't autocreated.

My project consists of App.js and two child components: View1.js and View2.js. I want to pass information from View1 to View2 and have that changing information reflected in the sketch of View 2. My problem is that although I can pass data from View 1 to View 2, I don\u2019t know how to update the sketch with the new value.

But for your scenario, depends_on is really not necessary as you already have wait-for-it.sh which have better control than depends_on to assure the start order. You can control the order of service startup and shutdown with the depends_on option. Compose always starts and stops containers in dependency order, where dependencies are determined by depends_on, links, volumes_from, and network_mode: \"service:...\".

The problem with deserializing to an interface is that you lose information Take the above example, trying to deserialize to the interface would involve telling the deserializer to only know about the properties on the interface - and any other fields your end user is supplying getting dropped entirely. On top of that you might have methods on the concrete class that support the interface properties that need to exist. There are some options involving reflection that you could use if you need the API to support multiple implementations of an interface, but the question is why you need the interface in the first place?

[duplicate] I've been working with an Indy TIdTCPServer object and instantiating a TXMLDocument object instance during the TIdTCPServer.OnExecute event.  I find it quite surprising that I get an exception when xml.Active is set to true: Microsoft MSXML is not installed Looking deeper, I found that the exception occurs because TMSXMLDOMDocumentFactory.TryCoCreateInstance() is unable to create the correct document object instance despite receiving the same GuidList as it received in other parts of the application from the main thread.  I don't understand why the object isn't instantiated if called from the component's thread. Here's the Embarcadero code where the object should be instantiated: I expect it must have something to do with CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER or CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wtypesbase/ne-wtypesbase-clsctx), but I don't see why these could be a problem. Even if that was the cause, how can I use TXMLDocument from within that event handler? MSXML is a COM-based technology. You need to call CoInitialize/Ex() to initialize the COM library in every thread context that accesses COM interfaces. Otherwise, in this case, CoCreateInstance() will fail with a CO_E_NOTINITIALIZED error. Delphi's RTL initializes the COM library for you in the main thread, but you have to do it yourself in worker threads, such as those used by TIdTCPServer. By default, TIdTCPServer creates a new thread for each client connection. In this case, the easiest place to initialize COM would be in the server's OnConnect event (since the OnExecute event is looped). However, since TIdTCPServer supports thread-pooling, and COM should be initialized only once per thread, the best place to initialize COM in this case 1 is directly in each thread's Execute() method. To do that, explicitly assign a TIdSchedulerOfThread-derived component (TIdSchedulerOfThreadDefault, TIdSchedulerOfThreadPool, etc) to the TIdTCPServer.Scheduler property (can be done at design-time), and then set the TIdSchedulerOfThread.ThreadClass property (must be done at runtime, before the server is activated) to a TIdThreadWithTask-derived class that overrides the virtual BeginExecute() and AfterExecute() methods. 1: at least until https://github.com/IndySockets/Indy/issues/6 is implemented in a future version of Indy. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2464": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69548815/find-substrings-in-binary-string", "Find substrings in binary string I am given string of 0s and 1s, and have to find distinct number of substrings such that: So, for example given 001101 answer would be 2: 0011, 01 Any suggestions?

[closed] Want to improve this question? Add details and clarify the problem by editing this post. Closed 10 hours ago. partial classes and methods states: When working with automatically generated source, code can be added to the class without having to recreate the source file. Visual Studio uses this approach when it creates Windows Forms, Web service wrapper code, and so on. You can create code that uses these classes without having to modify the file created by Visual Studio. What is the above text trying to explain? Let's take WinForms as the example here. Visual Studio has a GUI editor for making Forms. You drag and drop things from a Toolbox onto a grid. Ya' make buttons, labels, other things, etc. Pretty swanky. Now, behind the scenes, Visual Studio needs to take that GUI information and turn it into code. It generates a code file (such as Form1.Designer.cs), which is the code needed to make the form you created visually. This code file is a class. It has the partial keyword. That's the key here. That's what the bullet point is talking about. Let's say the class didn't have a partial keyword. How you would add your own custom logic to the form? Uh, well, you couldn't. You could inherit the class with your own, but that's not the same thing. You'd have to manually modify the generated code file, which, guess what, would be overwritten each time you make a change in GUI form designer. That's not very swanky. So, that's why you have a Form1.cs and Form1.Designer.cs file. The second is the generated file with the partial keyword, and the first is where you can extend the file with your own custom logic. One file for your stuff, one file for VS's stuff. You can write your custom logic in one file, and not have to worry that the changes will be removed when Visual Studio regenerates its file when the form layout is modified. They are merged at compile time because the partial keyword indicates they should be treated as one big class, just from two (or more) files. In C#, you can split the definition of a class into multiple partial definitions. They can be in separate files. Unlike in Java where each class is in a single file. This partial works in a single file also, so you can say: I never do this as big classes are typically horrible, so have not had a need to split them into files, but the docs mention examples where they have reasons: There are several situations when splitting a class definition is desirable: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2484": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69548765/is-it-possible-to-change-the-timestamp-of-a-dataframe-that-im-referencing", "Is it possible to change the timestamp of a dataframe that I'm referencing?

However, I ran into a bug, changed one of them into .equals() instead, and it fixed the bug. Is == bad? When should it and should it not be used? What's the difference? == tests for reference equality (whether they are the same object). .equals() tests for value equality (whether they are logically \"equal\"). Objects.equals() checks for null before calling .equals() so you don't have to (available as of JDK7, also available in Guava). Consequently, if you want to test whether two strings have the same value you will probably want to use Objects.equals(). You almost always want to use Objects.equals(). In the rare situation where you know you're dealing with interned strings, you can use ==. From JLS 3.10.5. String Literals: Moreover, a string literal always refers to the same instance of class String. This is because string literals - or, more generally, strings that are the values of constant expressions (\u00a715.28) - are \"interned\" so as to share unique instances, using the method String.intern. Similar examples can also be found in JLS 3.10.5-1. String.equalsIgnoreCase() value equality that ignores case. Beware, however, that this method can have unexpected results in various locale-related cases, see this question. String.contentEquals() compares the content of the String with the content of any CharSequence (available since Java 1.5). Saves you from having to turn your StringBuffer, etc into a String before doing the equality comparison, but leaves the null checking to you. == tests object references, .equals() tests the string values. Sometimes it looks as if == compares values, because Java does some behind-the-scenes stuff to make sure identical in-line strings are actually the same object. For example: But beware of nulls! == handles null strings fine, but calling .equals() from a null string will cause an exception: So if you know that fooString1 may be null, tell the reader that by writing The following are shorter, but it\u2019s less obvious that it checks for null: == compares Object references. .equals() compares String values. Sometimes == gives illusions of comparing String values, as in following cases: This is because when you create any String literal, the JVM first searches for that literal in the String pool, and if it finds a match, that same reference will be given to the new String. Because of this, we get: (a==b) ===> true However, == fails in the following case: In this case for new String(\"test\") the statement new String will be created on the heap, and that reference will be given to b, so b will be given a reference on the heap, not in String pool. Now a is pointing to a String in the String pool while b is pointing to a String on the heap. Because of that we get: if(a==b) ===> false. While .equals() always compares a value of String so it gives true in both cases: So using .equals() is always better. The == operator checks to see if the two strings are exactly the same object. The .equals() method will check if the two strings have the same value. Strings in Java are immutable. That means whenever you try to change/modify the string you get a new instance. You cannot change the original string. This has been done so that these string instances can be cached. A typical program contains a lot of string references and caching these instances can decrease the memory footprint and increase the performance of the program. When using == operator for string comparison you are not comparing the contents of the string, but are actually comparing the memory address. If they are both equal it will return true and false otherwise. Whereas equals in string compares the string contents. So the question is if all the strings are cached in the system, how come == returns false whereas equals return true? Well, this is possible. If you make a new string like String str = new String(\"Testing\") you end up creating a new string in the cache even if the cache already contains a string having the same content. In short \"MyString\" == new String(\"MyString\") will always return false. Java also talks about the function intern() that can be used on a string to make it part of the cache so \"MyString\" == new String(\"MyString\").intern() will return true. Note: == operator is much faster than equals just because you are comparing two memory addresses, but you need to be sure that the code isn't creating new String instances in the code. Otherwise you will encounter bugs. Make sure you understand why.  It's because the == comparison only compares references; the equals() method does a character-by-character comparison of the contents. When you call new for a and b, each one gets a new reference that points to the \"foo\" in the string table.  The references are different, but the content is the same. Yea, it's bad... == means that your two string references are exactly the same object. You may have heard that this is the case because Java keeps sort of a literal table (which it does), but that is not always the case. Some strings are loaded in different ways, constructed from other strings, etc., so you must never assume that two identical strings are stored in the same location. Equals does the real comparison for you. Yes, == is bad for comparing Strings (any objects really, unless you know they're canonical).  == just compares object references.  .equals() tests for equality. For Strings, often they'll be the same but as you've discovered, that's not guaranteed always. Java have a String pool under which Java manages the memory allocation for the String objects. See String Pools in Java When you check (compare) two objects using the == operator it compares the address equality into the string-pool. If the two String objects have the same address references then it returns true, otherwise false. But if you want to compare the contents of two String objects then you must override the equals method. equals is actually the method of the Object class, but it is Overridden into the String class and a new definition is given which compares the contents of object. But mind it respects the case of String. If you want case insensitive compare then you must go for the equalsIgnoreCase method of the String class. Let's See: I agree with the answer from zacherates. But what you can do is to call intern() on your non-literal strings. From zacherates example: If you intern the non-literal String equality is true: == compares object references in Java, and that is no exception for String objects. For comparing the actual contents of objects (including String), one must use the equals method. If a comparison of two String objects using == turns out to be true, that is because the String objects were interned, and the Java Virtual Machine is having multiple references point to the same instance of String. One should not expect that comparing one String object containing the same contents as another String object using == to evaluate as true. .equals() compares the data in a class (assuming the function is implemented). == compares pointer locations (location of the object in memory). == returns true if both objects (NOT TALKING ABOUT PRIMITIVES) point to the SAME object instance. .equals() returns true if the two objects contain the same data equals() Versus == in Java That may help you. == performs a reference equality check, whether the 2 objects (strings in this case) refer to the same object in the memory. The equals() method will check whether the contents or the states of 2 objects are the same. Obviously == is faster, but will (might) give false results in many cases if you just want to tell if 2 Strings hold the same text. Definitely the use of the equals() method is recommended. Don't worry about the performance. Some things to encourage using String.equals(): When all is said and done, even if we have a guarantee that the strings are interns, using the equals() method is still not that overhead that one might think, definitely the recommended way. If you want an efficient reference check, then use enums where it is guaranteed by the language specification and implementation that the same enum value will be the same object (by reference). If you're like me, when I first started using Java, I wanted to use the \"==\" operator to test whether two String instances were equal, but for better or worse, that's not the correct way to do it in Java. In this tutorial I'll demonstrate several different ways to correctly compare Java strings, starting with the approach I use most of the time. At the end of this Java String comparison tutorial I'll also discuss why the \"==\" operator doesn't work when comparing Java strings. Option 1: Java String comparison with the equals method Most of the time (maybe 95% of the time) I compare strings with the equals method of the Java String class, like this: This String equals method looks at the two Java strings, and if they contain the exact same string of characters, they are considered equal. Taking a look at a quick String comparison example with the equals method, if the following test were run, the two strings would not be considered equal because the characters are not the exactly the same (the case of the characters is different): But, when the two strings contain the exact same string of characters, the equals method will return true, as in this example: Option 2: String comparison with the equalsIgnoreCase method In some string comparison tests you'll want to ignore whether the strings are uppercase or lowercase. When you want to test your strings for equality in this case-insensitive manner, use the equalsIgnoreCase method of the String class, like this: Option 3: Java String comparison with the compareTo method There is also a third, less common way to compare Java strings, and that's with the String class compareTo method. If the two strings are exactly the same, the compareTo method will return a value of 0 (zero). Here's a quick example of what this String comparison approach looks like: While I'm writing about this concept of equality in Java, it's important to note that the Java language includes an equals method in the base Java Object class. Whenever you're creating your own objects and you want to provide a means to see if two instances of your object are \"equal\", you should override (and implement) this equals method in your class (in the same way the Java language provides this equality/comparison behavior in the String equals method). You may want to have a look at this ==, .equals(), compareTo(), and compare() Function: Test: The == operator check if the two references point to the same object or not. .equals() check for the actual string content (value). Note that the .equals() method belongs to class Object (super class of all classes). You need to override it as per you class requirement, but for String it is already implemented, and it checks whether two strings have the same value or not. Case 1 Reason: String literals created without null are stored in the String pool in the permgen area of heap. So both s1 and s2 point to same object in the pool. Case 2 Reason: If you create a String object using the new keyword a separate space is allocated to it on the heap. == compares the reference value of objects whereas the equals() method present in the java.lang.String class compares the contents of the String object (to another object). I think that when you define a String you define an object. So you need to use .equals(). When you use primitive data types you use == but with String (and any object) you must use .equals(). If the equals() method is present in the java.lang.Object class, and it is expected to check for the equivalence of the state of objects! That means, the contents of the objects. Whereas the == operator is expected to check the actual object instances are same or not. Example Consider two different reference variables, str1 and str2: If you use the equals() You will get the output as TRUE if you use ==. Now you will get the FALSE as output, because both str1 and str2 are pointing to two different objects even though both of them share the same string content. It is because of new String() a new object is created every time. Operator == is always meant for object reference comparison, whereas the String class .equals() method is overridden for content comparison: All objects are guaranteed to have a .equals() method since Object contains a method, .equals(), that returns a boolean. It is the subclass' job to override this method if a further defining definition is required. Without it (i.e. using ==) only memory addresses are checked between two objects for equality. String overrides this .equals() method and instead of using the memory address it returns the comparison of strings at the character level for equality. A key note is that strings are stored in one lump pool so once a string is created it is forever stored in a program at the same address. Strings do not change, they are immutable. This is why it is a bad idea to use regular string concatenation if you have a serious of amount of string processing to do. Instead you would use the StringBuilder classes provided. Remember the pointers to this string can change and if you were interested to see if two pointers were the same == would be a fine way to go. Strings themselves do not. You can also use the compareTo() method to compare two Strings. If the compareTo result is 0, then the two strings are equal, otherwise the strings being compared are not equal. The == compares the references and does not compare the actual strings. If you did create every string using new String(somestring).intern() then you can use the == operator to compare two strings, otherwise equals() or compareTo methods can only be used. In Java, when the == operator is used to compare 2 objects, it checks to see if the objects refer to the same place in memory. In other words, it checks to see if the 2 object names are basically references to the same memory location. The Java String class actually overrides the default equals() implementation in the Object class \u2013 and it overrides the method so that it checks only the values of the strings, not their locations in memory. This means that if you call the equals() method to compare 2 String objects, then as long as the actual sequence of characters is equal, both objects are considered equal. The == operator checks if the two strings are exactly the same object. The .equals() method  check if the two strings have the same value. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2489": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69548759/use-spark-sql-cli-to-load-csv-data-directly-into-parquet-table", "Use spark-sql cli to load csv data directly into parquet table I have a csv file and would like to load it into a parquet file on my hard drive, then run SQL queries against it using the spark-sql CLI.

A delegate is a special type of variable that can hold a reference to a method (not the result of the method but the method itself), allowing it to be passed around and invoked in places where you perhaps don't have access to the object the method belongs to. From the docs: Represents a delegate, which is a data structure that refers to a static method or to a class instance and an instance method of that class. Your code: Note the lack of () at the end of x.ToString. We're not calling x.ToString() here. We're creating a GetAString and passing x.ToString (which is a method that satisfies the signature required by the delegate). This means that when we call firstStringMethod() it will call x.ToString() and proxy the result to you. Consider another example: We could define multiple methods: And then switch according to user input: If the user inputs \"+\" then the result will be 7, while inputting \"*\" will result in \"12\".

That should make processsing much faster.   That is, after all bugs are fixed...  This also means, you should not need a mutex at all. There are other issues with your code... The most easily spotted is a memory leak. In main: More... You create a mutex on your very first line of executable code.  That's good... somewhat... Apart form the name, it's not in the right scope... If you want to use a mutex to protect DataStorage::vecData, this mutex should be declared in the same scope as DataStorage::vecData. One last thing.  Have you considered using iterators (aka pointers) as arguments to DataProcess::DataProcess() ?  This would simplify the code quite a bit, and it would very likely run faster. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2505": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69548707/bootstrap-putting-svg-to-to-top-right-and-top-left", "bootstrap putting svg to to top right and top left I'm trying to position an svg to the top left and right of my page but it doesn't seem to be working svg part whole code here is what it looks like right now site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2506": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69548706/retrieving-csv-worksheet-data-using-sheet-to-json-method", "Retrieving CSV Worksheet data using sheet_to_Json method?

I am able to read one row data using ExcelControlName.getCellNumericValue(\"ExcelSheetName\", RowNumber, ColNumber) but how do I set it up such that it automatically runs multiple times by running parameters from all rows. in your simulation model, create a parameter called row, and this will be the ONLY parameter that changes in your parameter variation experiment... then you will transform your parameters in your simulation to variables, and each variable will read the excel file as follows> where row, is the parameter that changes in your parameter variation experiment, and colNumber is the column representing the particular variable that you want to assess. A very useful question. One option is to make use of the Simulation Object and not let the model skip the experiment and run the model.  This will just give you some more control over your model execution and you can use some of the before and after simulation run code. Image the following super-simple model  I have a single parameter and an event that traces the parameter and then stops the simulation.

This ensures that the variable is updated with the correct data based on the run count, and that when you stop the model it will call the run function again if there is more values in the Excel sheet to load. Note that the row index in Excel starts at 1 and that we have a header for our data so we want to start at row 2, hence I added 2 + getExperiment().getRunCount() If you run this simple model you will see in the Console printed out the values from the Excel file. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2508": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69548702/how-to-get-the-union-of-two-special-arrays-in-javascripts", "How to get the union of two special arrays in javascripts [closed] Want to improve this question?

RemoveReference<T> does exactly what the name suggests - provides a Type without the reference.

I have my windows install, which I am using now, on my primary m.2 drive.

I'm attempting to perform a DMA that involves an AXI master fetching from an AXI slave. For simplicity, I elected to hook this system up through the TL front bus and system bus instead of directly to each other since other masters might need to access the AXI slave. I'm using Rocket Chip's default MMIO port. I've invoked it with the following MasterPortParams. Here's the MMIO port for reference. And here's the master node that's trying to issue a write. It begins issuing the write, but then I encounter an assertion failure  assert (!out.b.valid || b_valid) // Q must be ready faster than the response I'm trying to understand what this assertion is suggesting. It comes from the UserYanker. Here it is in context The b_bits are fetched from the queue and before setting the in b channel bits, we check this assertion. I'm still not quite sure what this means. My best guess is b.valid is going high before the UserYanker has space in its queue? Does this mean I need larger queues? If that's the case, what parameter would increase the UserYanker's queue size? Would it be maxFlight? Is this some sort of protocol translation issue from Tilelink to axi4?

I have it working for the most part, but I'm stuck at debugging. Here's a sample component I'm using for testing: When I load the component into a dev environment, I can't set breakpoints in Chrome's dev tools:  However, if I open my svelte.config.js, which initially look: And remove the optimizeImports() call, then breakpoints work correctly. Does anyone have any clue why this is happening? Clearly it's something to do with the carbon-preprocess-svelte library. I created a basic project that reproduces the issue: https://github.com/troncoso/carbon-svelte-bug TL;DR: The inline source map is kinda broken, it's a bug in carbon-preprocess-svelte. When you use: import { Tile } from 'carbon-components-svelte', the default module resolution will import the named export Tile from a big umbrella file at carbon-components-svelte/lib/index.js, which is a big minified code bundle. Clearly this is not optimal. optimizeImports from carbon-preprocess-svelte is a preprocessor that tries to optimize it by reading your import code then rewriting it into sth like import Tile from \"carbon-components-svelte/src/Tile/Tile.svelte\". Obviously there's some kind of bug in this preprocessor, that produces a broken source map. To be precise, it produces a source map that misses out some mapping positions. Chrome devtool relies on these mapping positions to set a breakpoint. When it's missing, it cannot set one. When you manually rewrite the import, you skip this preprocessor, thus you avoid the wrong behavior. This is consistent to your current finding. We might rest our case here and conclude that you should avoid using optimizeImports for now, and just report the bug to carbon team. Below will dive into more details. This is the inline source map of the bad case: And here's the one of the good case: They're base64 encoded json, if we decoded them, we get: bad case: good case: Problem lies in the mappings field. You can make sense of both files with the source map decoder then compare by clicking the dump button. You'll see that some mapping information are simply missing in the bad case file. This article Anatomy of source maps, if it interests you, will guide you through the technical details of the js source map format (to understand the mysterious ;;OAAiB,IAAA,MAAA,+CAAA;; part). But for now let's simply read the human-friendly dump: And here's the dump for both files. bad case mapping dump: good case mapping dump: Read @hackape's answer for details. But ultimately it seems like a bug with carbon-preprocess-svelte, specifically the optimizeImports() plugin. I created an issue on that project: https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-preprocess-svelte/issues/18 In the meantime, I came up with a solution that made sure the source maps work and I still get tree shaking. I created a carbon.ts file: When I need a component, I just add it to this file. Then I import the component like this: I know I could have just done the imports in the svelte files themselves, but this way when the bug is fixed I can much more easily find and replace all the imports. Just search for \"@/components/carbon\" and replace it with \"carbon-components-svelte\". site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2573": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69548570/angular-2-error-ts2339-property-posts-does-not-exist-on-type-bookcomponent", "Angular 2 error TS2339: Property 'posts' does not exist on type 'BookComponent' I am learning Angular 2 and am currently blocked by the following error.

Data jQuery, Ajax and html Files jQuery, Ajax and html How can I combine the above so that I can send data and files in one form via Ajax? My aim is to be able to send all of this form in one post with Ajax, is it possible? The problem I had was using the wrong jQuery identifier. You can upload data and files with one form using ajax. PHP + HTML jQuery + Ajax Short Version another option is to use an iframe and set the form's target to it. you may try this (it uses jQuery): it works well with all browsers, you don't need to serialize or prepare the data. one down side is that you can't monitor the progress. also, at least for chrome, the request will not appear in the \"xhr\" tab of the developer tools but under \"doc\" I was having this same issue in ASP.Net MVC with HttpPostedFilebase and instead of using form on Submit I needed to use button on click where I needed to do some stuff and then if all OK the submit form so here is how I got it working this will than correctly populate your MVC model, please make sure in your Model, The Property for HttpPostedFileBase[] has the same name as the Name of the input control in html i.e. Or shorter: For me, it didn't work without enctype: 'multipart/form-data' field in the Ajax request. I hope it helps someone who is stuck in a similar problem. Even though the enctype was already set in the form attribute, for some reason, the Ajax request didn't automatically identify the enctype without explicit declaration (jQuery 3.3.1). As others mentioned above, please also pay special attention to the contentType and processData fields. A Simple but more effective way:  new FormData() is itself like a container (or a bag). You can put everything attr or file in itself. The only thing you'll need to append the attribute, file, fileName eg: and just pass it in AJAX request. Eg: You can append n number of files or data with FormData. and if you're making AJAX Request from Script.js file to Route file in Node.js beware of using  req.body to access data (ie text)  req.files to access file (ie image, video etc) The code below works for me In your Action Post Method, pass parameter as HttpPostedFileBase UploadFile and make sure your file input has same as mentioned in your parameter of the Action Method. It should work with AJAX Begin form  as well. Remember over here that your AJAX BEGIN Form will not work over here since you make your post call defined in the code mentioned above and you can reference your method in the code as per the Requirement I know I am answering late but this is what worked for me This is a solution that I implemented In my case I had to make a POST request, which had information sent through the header, and also a file sent using a FormData object.

How can I get similar eigenvectors as given by matlab using python, numpy? Eigenvectors are not unique; if x is an eigenvector, then a * x is still an eigenvector for any scalar a. Look at the two results from python and matlab; the first column of vec from matlab looks like a scaled version of the third column of vec from python. The second column from matlab seems to be a scaled version of the second column from python (recall 1.88119544e-16 is almost zero). The third column corresponds to the first column. So my guess is that val from matlab is a reversed version of val from python; I can't verify this because I don't have matlab right now, but you can verify this.

For instance, maintain a counter with a time-window as key, and INCR/EXPIRE it in a single transaction via MULTI/EXEC: A problem with this approach is having to maintain a time window in the counter key, and potentially having multiple keys for a single ip address. The docs then state: An alternative implementation uses a single counter, but is a bit more complex to get it right without race conditions. Why is it complex to get this right? The following implementation seems simpler than the former: The strategy here is simply to add NX, ensuring that EXPIRE only acts if there is no expiration yet. We also set the expiration to 1 second to match the desired rate limiting period. Since this is performed in a single transaction, we're ensured to call EXPIRE after INCR. So, where is the race condition in this approach? Note: There are already some questions about why a client sending 2 separate transactions (one for INCR and one for EXPIRE) would face a race condition (or, more precisely, drop before EXPIRE). This question is specifically for the case where both operations are performed in a single transaction via MULTI/EXEC. The NX option for EXPIRE command is added in Redis 7.0, which is still not released yet (2021/10/13). However, the Rate Limiter examples works for current version of Redis. In fact, the Rate Limiter example also gives a Lua script solution: This Lua script solution works as EXPIRE with NX option, and should be faster, since it saves round-trip-time. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2595": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69548522/when-bootstrapping-percent-differences-why-is-this-for-loop-faster-than-purrrm", "When bootstrapping percent differences, why is this for-loop faster than purrr:map?

I can do this as follows: (proof that this works: link) So, given that I was able to use tree = lambda: defaultdict(tree) to replace is there a way I can use a modified version of tree = lambda: default(tree) to replace I have tried something like: But that would require tree to know which dictionary invoked the call to tree. E.g. in h = root['h'], root['h'] invokes a call to tree because h is not yet in root. tree would have to know it was invoked via the call root['h'] so that it could do h[BACKREF] = root. Is there a way around this? Is it a bad idea even if it can be done? I know the backreferences technically means that the trie will have cycles (and not be truly a tree), but the way I plan to traverse the trie, this won't be an issue. The reason I want backreferences is because it will be useful if I want to delete a word from the trie. For example, say I have the following trie:  and that I am at root['h']['e']['l']['l']['o'] and want to delete 'hello' from the trie. I can do this by backtracking up the trie from root['h']['e']['l']['l']['o'] to root['h']['e']['l']['l'] to root['h']['e']['l'] to root['h']['e'] (I stop here because len(set(root['h']['e'].keys()) - {BACKREF}) > 1. Then I can simply do del root['h']['e']['l'] and I will have cleaved off the 'llo$' from 'he' meaning the trie will still have 'hey'. Although there are alternatives, backtracking up the trie will be very easy with the backreferences. Using: one can create arbitrarily nested dicts. E.g. after: root will look like: This represents a tree that looks like this:  visualized using https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Trie.html The behaviour you're trying to implement seems easier to write as a class rather than a function.

This post was edited and submitted for review 10 hours ago and failed to reopen the post: Opinion-based Update the question so it can be answered with facts and citations by editing this post. C# has too many features to choose from. For example, using ValueTuple vs record vs struct, I now tend to use System.ValueTuple a lot - mostly fo configurable items. I like value types (stack frame quick allocation/recollection, direct access since field instead of property, Implements many useful interfaces). My question is when should I use this: over this: One use been: ... while using this appsettings.json: In the most cases, the usage of a Tuple is going to be wrong. I would always start with a class, and only then if that doesn\u2019t look right, try a Tuple. But adding a Tuple to start with, in most cases is going to be a bad move. If you want to evolve the tuple to hold more info (meaning, adding a new value to the tuple), you break code everywhere because now you have a new type. If you have a case class, you can add a new field, and the code will compile everywhere; now you\u2019d just need to use the new field everywhere you want the extra info, and the remaining code can be left exactly the same. And this is just another case, when tuples are not good. if you try this you will see not very pleasant result if you use a concrete class you will see a very different picture. First one of course (Well in this case). The most important part of programming are: Let's say you are not the one who started the project from scratch and joining the company with ongoing project. Understanding the classes with proper property names and why the other programmer implemented them will be much easier with classes and you can reuse them at other parts of the project as well. Maintaining and adding new properties for classes much easier than Tuples. Tuples are very useful as well but you need to know when to use them and not make your code unreadable by using them where you shouldn't. Other point is speed: Usually handling classes are way faster than tuples. And as @Serge mentioned sometimes you can't use tuples. For example when you want to have a constructor or default values. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2614": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69548457/how-do-i-easily-and-reliably-install-pam-files-on-ubuntu", "How do I easily and reliably install Pam files on Ubuntu?

I am running into an issue where the behaviour of the debugger and VSCode does not make sense, claiming it cannot resolve non-existent files from paths that it should not be looking for these packages at. The lambda function has been tested locally using the aws-sam-cli's sam build and sam local invoke functionality. The lambda correctly takes a JSON event with -e, and returns the expected response. This has been tested with the following setup for its SAM template: The launch.json, referenced from https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/serverless-apps-run-debug-config-ref.html, is configured as follows: When attempting to debug via Run > Start Debugging in VSCode, the docker build completes successfully, and the debugger attaches as per the AWS Toolkit logs. The Dockerfile in question is as follows: After setting a breakpoint on the first line of index.py, which is import time, the debugger stops as expected and all is fine. When I begin to step through the lambda code, there is another import from one of my modules where I am importing from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch. This is where the first issue appears. VSCode throws an error window in the bottom right with the following message: Where lambdacode is the root directory containing the lambda code, module directories, requirement.txt, etc. I am unable to determine why the debugger is looking for these packages at this workspace path. It seems as if the debugger is not utilizing the docker container at all, since it is looking locally for the packages. For reference, urllib3 is installed system wide on my machine, installed in my virtual environment, and installed in the docker container in question. Why is the debugger attempting to look exactly here in my workspace folder for the package, and is not utilizing the docker container? Is this a behaviour that I can change somehow? Even after stepping over this import and ignoring the error, there continues to be identical errors for other libraries such as dateutil etc, which are also installed everywhere that makes sense. I have confirmed this is an issue with this simple import statement, as I pulled an AWS SAM example with sam init, and chose the Hello World Image Example for Python3.8, confirmed it debugged as-is, added the import and the requirement for elasticsearch, and encountered the same error when I tried to run the debugger again.

I was recently tasked in designing a tool that visualizes movement of multiple objects in the x and y axis. (With talks to possibly extend it with the z axis) The non negotiable requirement is to code this in Visual Studio C++, as people who would maintaining the software are C++ developers, specifically RTOS related and they could focus on logic instead of learning a new language if a problem happens in the software. I was thinking to have an OpenGL area and the window layout would look like the image below.  A and B are the objects moving in the x and y axis and the \"Movement Range\" is the area they can move in. The \"Movement Range\" will be changing depending on time. Will be reading the X and Y coordinates and size of the movement range from a CSV file and then scaling this to the window. Will OpenGL do the job or will this bite me in the ass once I start implementing this? What would you recommend I use?

What the Outbound Rules do is prevent the server from making connections to outside resources on the destination port specified. So a server in that security group won't be able to connect to another machine on TCP/3000, that's not the same as what you're attempting to prevent. When you connect to https://stackoverflow.com, the destination port is 443, but that's not the port that your computer opens to send the request. It uses an Ephemeral Port, a temporary usage of a port in the upper ranges (AWS considers 1024-65535 the range of ephemeral ports). You can see what ports your system decided to use via netstat from your terminal to get an idea of how many are in use in a typical session. So, to block responses from your application, you'd have to know in advance what port you're using to make the connection (e.g., 44732) and deny it. That can't happen easily, so you would either want to block the whole range (which will likely cause many other problems) or rethink your strategy handling the responses while testing. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2644": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69548407/python-list-problem-why-does-the-function-produce-light-blue-vscode", "python list problem-Why does the function produce light blue?-vscode First Case First case is working, so i made a function to sort even,odd (Problem Happen!!)

I'm having some trouble wrapping my head around the concept, and I feel like I may have a fundamental misunderstanding as to how this is implemented in C++. I saw some similar code online that seemed to convert the parameter list into a vector, which I tried implementing below (note that I need a vector of pointers so that I can call child object implementations of the accept() method). The code gives these errors on line 52: I don't really need it to be in a vector. I am just wondering as to how I can access members of the argument list so that I can call their version of the accept() method. There are 3 different ways to accept a variable number of arguments. First, C style varargs.  You probably do not want this. Second, C++ variadic templates.  If everything is the same type, probably overkill. Lastly, something like a std::initializer_list if the data is const.  Otherwise, just a std::vector. At the call site, do printer.parenthesize(\"foo\", {Expr0, Expr1, Expr2});.  Notice the extra {}.

Because of this, I'd like to include a pre-defined decorator in my C-extension that can decorate functions that are called in Python files that include my extension. I can't seem to find anything in the CPython api documentation that describes how write decorators. Any help/direction would be appreciated. Specifically, I'd like the Python code to look like the following: Where my_decorator would use the argument '1' to carry out some functionality (written in c inside my_c_extension) before func is called, and more functionality after func is called. Thanks in advance! For problems like this, it's often helpful to first mock things up in Python. In your case, I expected there'd be two benefits: If you do end up implementing the decorator entirely in an extension module, this will help you understand how it should work and what state will be held by which objects you'll be creating. Often, you can simplify the problem by doing most of the work in Python. For the sake of argument, let's say what you're really trying to do is use a C extension to help sample low-level CPU counters for performance tuning. Here would be a way to achieve that with a hybrid of Python and C. All the complicated decorator magic stays in Python while only the functionality that actually needs to be in C is in C. If that's not viable (too slow, more complicated than this, etc.), then you'll need to create extension objects in C that replicate the behavior of the wrapper and wrapped functions. It's definitely doable, but it'll take a bit of work, and it'll be harder to maintain.

While studying database related content, I came across the following: When table R is vertically partitioned into R1, R2, R3..., Rn, it is said that it can be expressed as R = R1\u22c8R2\u22c8R3...\u22c8Rn. (\u22c8 is the join symbol) However, if the join symbol is used without any special conditions, it becomes a Cartesian product, so doesn't that result in much more tuples than in the original table R? Can you please explain why the existing table is represented as a join of a partitioned table? That operator means natural join.  See https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra: Natural join (\u22c8) is a binary operator that is written as (R \u22c8 S) where R and S are relations.[2] The result of the natural join is the set of all combinations of tuples in R and S that are equal on their common attribute names. \u22c8 is natural join. (When used with 2 relation arguments & no others.) Natural join is Cartesian product when there are no common columns. But in the quote the assumption is that the partitioning is done so that there is a set of key values all tables use. So Cartesian product doesn't come up. Every partition has the same number of rows & the same key content & they differ in additional column content.

However, when I hover over a widget, the widget beneath it overlaps  and the background is cut off at the bottom.

First of all, setting hardcoded content margins of a layout based on the overall layout is a serious problem for many reasons: After seriously considering the above matters (which are very important and should never be underestimated), the problem is that, while Qt allows to lay out items \"outside\" their possible position through QSS paddings, you need to consider the widget z-level, which by default stacks a new widget above any other previously created sibling widget (widgets that have a common ancestor), and that's why you see partially hidden check boxes. The base solution would be to install an event filter, check if it's a HoverMove event type and then call raise_() to ensure that it's put above any other sibling: Again, this will only partially solve your problem, as you'll soon find out that your hardcoded sizes and positions will not work well (remember, what you see on your screen is never what others see on theirs). A possible solution would be to create a separate QWidget subclass for the menu, add checkboxes in there, and always compute the maximum height considering the padding. Then, to ensure that the widget box is properly put where it should you should add a addStretch() or at least a \"main widget\" (which is what is normally used for a \"main window\"). Note that in the code above I still used an event filter while still using explicit opaque background colors, if you are fine with the parent background, you can avoid installing and using the event filter and only set the default background to the transparent rgb(0, 0, 0, 0). site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2679": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69548334/what-does-fs0x30-provide-in-linux", "What does fs:0x30 provide in Linux?

The fs segment register is used in x86-64 Linux to point to thread-local storage.  See How are the fs/gs registers used in Linux AMD64? So this instruction will xor the rdx register with the value found at offset 0x30 in the thread-local storage block. This code is part of a pointer encryption mechanism in glibc to help harden against certain exploits.  There is some explanation of it at https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/PointerEncryption.  The value at fs:0x30 is an \"key\" for a trivial \"encryption\" algorithm; pointers are xor'ed with this value (and then rotated) when they are stored, and rotated back and xor'ed again when they are retrieved from memory, which recovers the original pointer. There is no particular significance to the number 0x30; it just happens to be the offset where that value is stored.  You can see in the inline assembly that this number comes from offsetof (tcbhead_t, pointer_guard); so the storage at the fs base address is laid out as a tcbhead_t struct, and given the other members that it contains, the pointer_guard member has ended up at offset 0x30.  So looking at the name pointer_guard for the member is more informative than its numerical offset. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2680": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69548333/updating-varchar-column-over-linked-server-with-parameterized-query-causes-remot", "Updating varchar column over linked server with parameterized query causes remote scan and cursorfetch I'm issuing a fairly simple update of a single varchar column against a remote linked server - like this: And that works fine when is written as an ad-hoc query:  Parameterized queries bad When we do what we're supposed to do, and have our SqlCommand issue it as a parameterized query, the SQL ends up being: (not strictly true, but close enough) This parameterized form of the query ends up performing a remote scan against the linked server:  It creates a cursor on the linked server, and takes about 35 seconds to pull back 1.2M rows to the local server through a series of hundreds of sp_cursorfetch - each pulling down a few thousand rows. Why, in the world, would the local SQL Server optimizer ever decide to pull back all 1.2M rows to the local server in order to update anything? And even if it was going to decide to pull back rows to the local server, why in the world would it do it using a cursor? It only fails on varchar columns. If I try updating an INT column, it works fine. But this column is varchar - and it fails. I tried other parametrizing the column as nvarchar, and it's still bad. Every answer I've seen actually are questions: I already have my workaround: parameterized queries bad - use ad-hoc queries. I was hoping for an explanation of the thing that makes no sense. And hopefully if we have an explanation we can fix it - rather than workaround it. Of course I can't reproduce it anywhere except the customer's live environment.

The NY Times has a game called Spelling Bee, with the goal of listing valid English words.  The initial conditions are a set of seven letters, with one letter designated as 'required to be in each word, at least once'.  The minimum word length is 4, and there is no maximum.  To amuse myself I started to write a program to generate such words. An example: on October 12,2021, the set of letters is 'cpithde', and 'c' is the required letter.  Acceptable words include: and so on. I know about itertools, with its permutations('abcd', N), combinations() with and without replacement, and product(). None of those do exactly what I want.  I know I can brute-force the generation of the appropriate  strings, but I am curious if there is a combination of library functions that will do it. To clarify the problem:  consider the word diced.  The letter d appears two times. And on October 11, the word riffraff was a valid and high-scoring word, with twice-duplicated r and 4-times-duplicated f.

So, Then I realized, seeing pre_save and post_save actions in logs, that I'm likely doing something wrong - calling save in the function which is called (twice) from parent's save, as per docs. The first question is, then - why doesn't it send me into an infinite loop? And the second (and probably more important) - why am I only seeing the receiver function executing on removing items from the cart, but not on adding them? Removing is done via cart.products.remove(product_obj) , but adding via cart_obj.cartitem_set.add(cart_item_obj, bulk=False) , which is probably related to why removal triggers the receiver, while adding does not. But that complicates the question even more - having sender set to be CartItem, I would expect removal, performed on product, to miss the receiver, not adding, which works on cartitems directly (though removal of products removes CartItems too, through the on_delete=CASCADE). The m2m_changed signal will be triggered when modifying a ManyToManyField (products in this case). From the docs: So for your questions: why doesn't it send me into an infinite loop? This is because recalculate_and_save didn't do anything with the m2m field products, so it won't trigger the m2m_changed signal again avoiding the infinite loop. why am I only seeing the receiver function executing on removing items from the cart, but not on adding them? Since the signal will only come from when modifying products, doing things with cartitem_set will not trigger it.

Thank you! A service process must call the right dll function to indicate that it is starting, and to receive pause / stop events. In .net there's an implementation of these dll calls built into System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase There's an implementation of a service built into asp.net, which I believe pre-dates the introduction of the generic host. Just calling IWebHost.RunAsService() would be enough to glue the windows service start / stop events into the web host start / stop lifetime. I believe all you need to do is call .UseWindowsService() when configuring your host builder.

I need to display the total work hours for each worker. There are different work shifts. The most complex one, in this case, is the dawn-shift when the person works from 21:00 on a day to 7:00 on the next day, considering day offsets, i.e. on 31th October there is a time change in Switzerland. I intend to apply the logic only within the country. Would the following code be a reliable solution for this scenario? I have tried to understand java.time and many posts for this specific issue, but they all got more confuse. My entity model looks like: My Db schema looks like:  Thank you all for your efforts and time in advance. It\u2019s very simple. If you will just allow it to be. I recommend that you use java.time, the modern Java date and time API, for all of your date and time work. Let\u2019s try it out. For constructing some Work objects I wrote the following helper method. It accepts strings for the dates and times. Demonstration: Output: In a normal night we would expect the time from 21:00 to 7:00 to be 10 hours. You can see in the above output that in the night between October 30 and 31, where Europe turns its clocks back after summer time (DST), it\u2019s 11 hours. Edit: If one is in doubt, here\u2019s a way to see it: The worker first works from 21 to 3 = 6 hours. Then the clocks are turned back to 2. The worker then continues working from 2 to 7 = 5 hours. So the total time worked i 6 + 5 hours = 11 hours. So the code calculates the actual time elapsed (not the difference between the clock hours). Giving just a partial answer to your question as asked. There isn\u2019t much reliable about the old date and time classes from Java 1.0 and 1.1. Even if you get code to work with them, it will often be needlessly complicated code, and the risk of some fellow programmer introducing a bug later should not be overlooked. I didn\u2019t test your code with data from the nights of fall back (for example 30\u201331 October 2021) and spring forward (expected 26\u201327 March 2022). You can do that yourself. You have got a very long work shift from 2021-10-13 07:00 to 2021-10-14 17:45. It may be an error in the data, but work time should be calculated correctly, which will also help the user notice if it is indeed an error. The correct duration is 34 hours 45 minutes. It seems from your screen shot that your code has calculated it as just 10 hours 45 minutes.

Even SO, it appears to me, does not have all the answers, so here is my attempt at self-answering the question: How exactly does the \"Copy Local\" property of an assembly reference work in Visual Studio? And does the project use the assembly copied to the bin folder every time or does it use the assembly from the GAC? \"Copy Local\" when set to true ensures that the dll for the assembly reference is added to the referencing project's bin folder so that it's available at the run time. If the required dll is not found in the bin folder then, the one in GAC can be used. If even then, the dll is not found, we will encounter errors. If the same version of the dll exists in bin as well as GAC then, the one from GAC is used but if a different version is used and referenced in the project then the one from bin gets used.

For example, if I do this: I am telling typescript that the function pick returns a Foo object, yet it doesn't have the key a defined. The use case is that we have API calls that we: If you're okay with the implementation of pick not typechecking, then you can at least make the types all line up. The super-handy Typescript type we're going to use for this is actually called Pick. The function implementation is the exact same, except that at the end we cast through any, which effectively tells Typescript to trust us. Pick<T, K> is exactly the type you want: it says \"take the type T, subscript it with the type K, and see what we get\". K is an arbitrary type that extends keyof T. Assuming you pass constant arguments to this function, you'll get a union of literals type like \"a\" | \"b\" for K. I don't know of a way to get Object.fromEntries to typecheck, short of casting through any like we did above.

Your server can look at the HTTP_USER_AGENT header in the HTTP request that the client sends to the server.  This header typically contains information about the user agent that made the request - i.e. if the request originated from a web browser, then the user agent information will generally contain the vendor and version of the browser.  So, your server can respond conditionally based on what the client sends in this header.

The websocket c++ library I'm using atm is websocketpp or websocket++. I wrote an app that allows clients to connect over ws and localhost, but when I add an ip for the address, connections don't occur at all. Now I think I have to use ssl and wss for ip connection? I tried it and there is some connection activity, but then the handshake times out. Could I be experiencing cross-orgin issues, or what, do i need ssl? I am new to websockets. Could the problem be my ssl certs I made with openssl? I can post code, or if you are familiar with a c++ library to do websockets, what is it? Is this even a possible thing to do? There could be multiple reasons why it won't connect over ip. The first is port forwarding. On a local network it's not necessary but running a server over a remote network, portforwarding has to be done. You can just run your server then use a simple port checker (there's many websites for them) to see if a connection can be established. The other reason could be as you said ssl. If you are running your client on a web host, the host may require a connection to be made over ssl/wss for websockets. If your server isn't running a valid ssl certificate then this could prevent the client from connecting to your server. I know for exampe Github pages requires the server to be running wss or valid ssl certificates on the server side in order for a client connection to be established; however, if you use a custom domain name for Github pages then you can disable the need for ssl. In order to get valid ssl certificates you would need to register a domain for your ip address then either buy certificates or use free certificates from zerossl or other distributors. Here is a game I have written which connects to a c++ server which I'm running on my own machine with its own domain with valid ssl certificates and the client is running on github pages with a custom domain I have registered.

I'm unable to see the variables sent from my content.js script to my background.js script. I don't have any need to cache data between sessions, and only want my script running in the current tab that the user is on. My Content.js script should be executing with the \"run_at\": \"document_idle\" located in the Manifest.js. Content.js Runs > setBadgeAction shows metric on icon in Background.js > user can open report in extension Popup Background.js: content.js: popup.js popup.html manifest.js There are a couple of small issues, which I will address first: background.js: content.js There is another conceptual matter, related to the flow of data between parts of the extension, and when the different parts will be active/inactive and able to receive messages. It appears the intended flow is to send data from content script to background and popup more or less simultaneously. The background service worker can be used to receive the message from content, then update the badge text, and it will work correctly after addressing the syntax issues listed above. The popup is active when the user has physically clicked on the extension icon and the popup is open. After the popup loses focus, it will get recycled and reloads next time user clicks extension icon. When user is focused on the tab and content script runs, the popup cannot be open simultaneously, and therefore cannot receive the message. In order to pass data to the popup you will need some intermediary to receive it from content and then provide it to popup, when popup is loaded and ready to receive it. In manifest V2 it would have (maybe) been reasonable to use the background for this purpose since it is not intended to be stored for a long time, but with MV3, the background service worker is short-lived, and after a while it will become inactive. It will not work as a reliable intermediary for holding data, even temporarily, for this reason. You can find some official discussion about this topic here. To achieve the intended behavior, I suggest using the storage API. This will allow capturing the data in the content script, and recovering the same data in the popup whenever the popup is ready to be loaded. This was perhaps already the intent, since the storage is included in the manifest permissions, which is needed. You may want to consider using some lookup key to get data from storage for each specific tab, if the counts will vary in that regard, then clear the storage data when tab/window/browser closes. Here is an edited version with the suggested changes content.js background.js popup.js In popup.html I would move <script src=\"popup.js\"></script> after the <p> tags to the end of the body, since it looks for elements by id, just to be sure those ids exist. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2733": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69548228/i-need-to-fetch-my-pivot-values-from-many-to-many-relationship-data", "I need to fetch my pivot values from many to many relationship data I have done much research about this but I can't fetch the pivot table as I want.

The main reason for handleErrors is for logging errors and to be able to get the function name where the error is thrown.

In some cases, when the callback function itself is a hook instead of an arrow function,  the eslint warning goes away. See Example code below. Here's some code, with a codesandbox. (Warning: Contrived and do-nothing code ahead). The Rules state: Don\u2019t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function, before any early returns. Assuming that \"top level\" means top of the call stack, not nested: I would say that in this case, the call to useCb() is not at the top level of the React function because it is nested in Array.map(), and is also in a loop. I consider Array.map() to be a loop. The standard eslint warning reads: React Hook \"<hook_name>\" cannot be called inside a callback. React Hooks must be called in a React function component or a custom React Hook function. (react-hooks/rules-of-hooks) To me this implies mutual exclusion, as in: \"If it's in a React function component or custom React Hook function, then it's not inside a callback and therefore is OK.\" But in this case, I would say that the useSomething() hook is called inside the callback useCb(), which is also a custom React Hook function. I can see why this may be a risky, \"bad idea\". If list is dynamic, then the number of hook calls may change. But if it violates the Rules of Hooks and is otherwise a risky bad idea, why is there no linting warning or React error about incorrect hook usage? Is this just a case of omissions in the error checking and / or ambiguity in the verbiage? Or is it a legitimate implementation for rare edge cases where the order and number of hook calls does not change?

If you're running a query, that is the space that Oracle uses for things like sorts and the like.  While it is certainly possible that you'd really want to extend the size of your TEMP tablespace, it is much more common that the issue is that the particular query you're running has a bug that is causing it to use excessive amounts of TEMP space.  If, for example, you've missed a join condition and you're creating a Cartesian product, throwing TEMP space at the problem is unlikely to fix it-- you'd need to fix the query.

I suspect it's unicode related but would like to understand precisely what is happening and how can I correctly compare such charaters. Why is '\u2714\ufe0f' treated differently than '\u274c'? I encountered it in this simple char counting Because \u2714\ufe0f takes two characters: \"\u2714\ufe0f\".length === 2 \"\u2714\ufe0f\"[0] === \"\u2714\" an \"\u2714\ufe0f\"[1] denotes color, I think. And \"\u274c\".length === 1 so it take only one character. It's similar to the way emojis with different skin colors work as well. As to how to compare, I think that \"\u2714\ufe0f\".codePointAt(0) (not to confuse with charCodeAt()) might help. See https://thekevinscott.com/emojis-in-javascript/: codePointAt and fromCodePoint are new methods introduced in ES2015 that can handle unicode characters whose UTF-16 encoding is greater than 16 bits, which includes emojis. Use these instead of charCodeAt, which doesn\u2019t handle emoji correctly. I believe the '\u2714\ufe0f' is made up of 2 components. When you output '\u2714\ufe0f'[0] you get  '\u2714', and the black checkmark does not equal the green checkmark. However, the '\u274c' is made up of just a single component, so when you output '\u274c'[0], you get the same thing: '\u274c'. The second char '\u2714\ufe0f'[1](code point = 65039) is a Variation Selector A Variation Selector specifies that the preceding character should be displayed with emoji presentation. Only required if the preceding character defaults to text presentation. Often used in Emoji ZWJ Sequences, where one or more characters in the sequence have text and emoji presentation, but otherwise default to text (black and white) display.

I've tried turning stuff on in App Service logs, Diagnostic  settings but nothing seems to work. The only way how I can store logs (however not in Blob storage but on the App Service File System) is by using Application Logging (Filesystem) option. The problem with this option is that it is automatically turned off after 12 hours. It is written here that they only support .NET applications but I am not sure that I've understood it correctly. It seemed to me that such a essential functionality must be somehow supported. So I wanted to ask, is there some other way or library that can be used for storing logs of Node.js web app in the Blob storage? The recommended approach for logging with an Azure App Service is usually Application Insights (see here and here and here for more information).  You can configure retention policies for blob storage (if needed beyond the defaults) As per this doc, Currently only .NET application logs can be written to the blob storage.

Update the question so it's on-topic for Stack Overflow. Closed 7 hours ago. This post was edited and submitted for review 6 hours ago. So the problem is when I try to add a delay with a setTimeout func but nothing happens. I've been coding bat for about a year now, and only just started js a few weeks ago and this is really confuziling. I currently just want there to be a way so that I can essentially goto the top of the loop, and repeat it. I did some research and found that I'm using a bat hybrid or something along the lines of that. My issue is that I am getting no output or anything from this current scrip and nothing seems to be working. I found a post that goes over a similar concept with the whole hybrid thing ( Is it possible to embed and execute VBScript within a batch file without using a temporary file? If I could find a way to write bat at the bottom of my current script, and remove the settimeout func that would be awesome! I hope this makes more sense than last time, thanks. In pure DOS some guys use PING to give a fake break. I prefer to use CHOICE which is a command that waits for you to type some key, but you can set a timeout and if nothing is pressed it picks the key you set as default and sends it to %errorLevel%. For example: The above command waits for 3 seconds for you to type w, s, d or 5. You can leave the ask blank without /M parameter, so it won't show anything, just waiting. And if some key is pressed, it doesn't show, sending to nul. In your case, you can define a label in your program and keep it repeating. \u2588 is a \"key\" inside the decimal charcode range 128\u2192255 of the USA charset 437. It's just for the user not to be able to press any |conventional keys|>a-z, A-Z, 0-9. You can achieve this by converting a hex to a letter in your batch file.

[duplicate] I have an array like this: How can I randomize / shuffle it? The de-facto unbiased shuffle algorithm is the Fisher-Yates (aka Knuth) Shuffle. See https://github.com/coolaj86/knuth-shuffle You can see a great visualization here (and the original post linked to this)  Some more info about the algorithm used. Here's a JavaScript implementation of the Durstenfeld shuffle, an optimized version of Fisher-Yates: It picks a random element for each original array element, and excludes it from the next draw, like picking randomly from a deck of cards. This clever exclusion swaps the picked element with the current one, then picks the next random element from the remainder, looping backwards for optimal efficiency, ensuring the random pick is simplified (it can always start at 0), and thereby skipping the final element. Algorithm runtime is O(n). Note that the shuffle is done in-place so if you don't want to modify the original array, first make a copy of it with .slice(0). The new ES6 allows us to assign two variables at once. This is especially handy when we want to swap the values of two variables, as we can do it in one line of code. Here is a shorter form of the same function, using this feature. Warning! The use of this algorithm is not recommended, because it is inefficient and strongly biased; see comments. It is being left here for future reference, because the idea is not that rare. This https://javascript.info/array-methods#shuffle-an-array tutorial explains the differences straightforwardly. You can do it easily with map and sort: You can shuffle polymorphic arrays, and the sort is as random as Math.random, which is good enough for most purposes. Since the elements are sorted against consistent keys that are not regenerated each iteration, and each comparison pulls from the same distribution, any non-randomness in the distribution of Math.random is canceled out. Speed Time complexity is O(N log N), same as quick sort. Space complexity is O(N). This is not as efficient as a Fischer Yates shuffle but, in my opinion, the code is significantly shorter and more functional. If you have a large array you should certainly use Fischer Yates. If you have a small array with a few hundred items, you might do this. One could (or should) use it as a protoype from Array: From ChristopheD: Use the underscore.js library. The method _.shuffle() is nice for this case. Here is an example with the method: NEW!

Caching somewhere else var rnd=Math.random and then use rnd() would also increase slightly the performance on big arrays. http://jsfiddle.net/vvpoma8w/2/ Readable version (use the original version. this is slower, vars are useless, like the closures & \";\", the code itself is also shorter ... maybe read this How to 'minify' Javascript code , btw you are not able to compress the following code in a javascript minifiers like the above one.) Shuffle Array In place ES6 Pure, Iterative Reliability and Performance Test Some solutions on this page aren't reliable (they only partially randomise the array).

Here is the EASIEST one, for further example, you can check it here Modern short inline solution using ES6 features: (for educational purposes) benchmarks Let's first see the results then we'll look at each implementation of shuffle below -    splice is slow Any solution using splice or shift in a loop is going to be very slow. Which is especially noticeable when we increase the size of the array. In a naive algorithm we - To exaggerate the slow effect, we'll demonstrate this on an array of one million elements. The following script almost 30 seconds -  pop is fast The trick is not to splice and instead use the super efficient pop. To do this, in place of the typical splice call, you - Now we can shuffle one million elements in less than 100 milliseconds -  even faster The two implementations of shuffle above produce a new output array. The input array is not modified. This is my preferred way of working however you can increase the speed even more by shuffling in place. Below shuffle one million elements in less than 10 milliseconds -  First of all, have a look here for a great visual comparison of different sorting methods in javascript. Secondly, if you have a quick look at the link above you'll find that the random order sort seems to perform relatively well compared to the other methods, while being extremely easy and fast to implement as shown below: Edit: as pointed out by @gregers, the compare function is called with values rather than indices, which is why you need to use indexOf. Note that this change makes the code less suitable for larger arrays as indexOf runs in O(n) time. All the other answers are based on Math.random() which is fast but not suitable for cryptgraphic level randomization. The below code is using the well known Fisher-Yates algorithm while utilizing Web Cryptography API for cryptographic level of randomization.  Update: Here I'm suggesting a relatively simple (not from complexity perspective) and short algorithm that will do just fine with small sized arrays, but it's definitely going to cost a lot more than the classic Durstenfeld algorithm when you deal with huge arrays. You can find the Durstenfeld in one of the top replies to this question. Original answer: If you don't wish your shuffle function to mutate the source array, you can copy it to a local variable, then do the rest with a simple shuffling logic. Shuffling logic: pick up a random index, then add the corresponding element to the result array and delete it from the source array copy. Repeat this action until the source array gets empty. And if you really want it short, here's how far I could get: You can do it easily with:  Please reference at JavaScript Sorting Arrays Using Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm and ES6: We're still shuffling arrays in 2019, so here goes my approach, which seems to be neat and fast to me:  yet another implementation of Fisher-Yates, using strict mode: A simple modification of CoolAJ86's answer that does not modify the original array: Randomize  array the shortest arrayShuffle function Though there are a number of implementations already advised but I feel we can make it shorter and easier using forEach loop, so we don't need to worry about calculating array length and also we can safely avoid using a temporary variable. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2789": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69548119/xor-a-list-of-booleans-in-haskell", "XOR a list of booleans in Haskell [closed] Want to improve this question?

How can I extract the information, i.e. access a specific or multiple values (or keys)? For example: How could I access the name of the second item in items? JavaScript has only one data type which can contain multiple values: Object. An Array is a special form of object. (Plain) Objects have the form Arrays have the form Both arrays and objects expose a key -> value structure. Keys in an array must be numeric, whereas any string can be used as key in objects. The key-value pairs are also called the \"properties\". Properties can be accessed either using dot notation or bracket notation, if the property name would not be a valid JavaScript identifier name [spec], or the name is the value of a variable: For that reason, array elements can only be accessed using bracket notation: JSON is a textual representation of data, just like XML, YAML, CSV, and others. To work with such data, it first has to be converted to JavaScript data types, i.e. arrays and objects (and how to work with those was just explained). How to parse JSON is explained in the question Parse JSON in JavaScript? . How to access arrays and objects is fundamental JavaScript knowledge and therefore it is advisable to read the MDN JavaScript Guide, especially the sections A nested data structure is an array or object which refers to other arrays or objects, i.e. its values are arrays or objects. Such structures can be accessed by consecutively applying dot or bracket notation. Here is an example: Let's assume we want to access the name of the second item. Here is how we can do it step-by-step: As we can see data is an object, hence we can access its properties using dot notation. The items property is accessed as follows: The value is an array, to access its second element, we have to use bracket notation: This value is an object and we use dot notation again to access the name property. So we eventually get: Alternatively, we could have used bracket notation for any of the properties, especially if the name contained characters that would have made it invalid for dot notation usage: Most of the time when you are getting undefined, the object/array simply doesn't have a property with that name. Use console.log or console.dir and inspect the structure of object / array. The property you are trying to access might be actually defined on a nested object / array. If the property names are unknown or we want to access all properties of an object / elements of an array, we can use the for...in [MDN] loop for objects and the for [MDN] loop for arrays to iterate over all properties / elements. Objects To iterate over all properties of data, we can iterate over the object like so: Depending on where the object comes from (and what you want to do), you might have to test in each iteration whether the property is really a property of the object, or it is an inherited property. You can do this with Object#hasOwnProperty [MDN]. As alternative to for...in with hasOwnProperty, you can use Object.keys [MDN] to get an array of property names: Arrays To iterate over all elements of the data.items array, we use a for loop: One could also use for...in to iterate over arrays, but there are reasons why this should be avoided: Why is 'for(var item in list)' with arrays considered bad practice in JavaScript?. With the increasing browser support of ECMAScript 5, the array method forEach [MDN] becomes an interesting alternative as well: In environments supporting ES2015 (ES6), you can also use the for...of [MDN] loop, which not only works for arrays, but for any iterable: In each iteration, for...of directly gives us the next element of the iterable, there is no \"index\" to access or use. In addition to unknown keys, the \"depth\" of the data structure (i.e. how many nested objects) it has, might be unknown as well. How to access deeply nested properties usually depends on the exact data structure. But if the data structure contains repeating patterns, e.g. the representation of a binary tree, the solution typically includes to recursively [Wikipedia] access each level of the data structure. Here is an example to get the first leaf node of a binary tree:  A more generic way to access a nested data structure with unknown keys and depth is to test the type of the value and act accordingly. Here is an example which adds all primitive values inside a nested data structure into an array (assuming it does not contain any functions). If we encounter an object (or array) we simply call toArray again on that value (recursive call).  Since the structure of a complex object or array is not necessarily obvious, we can inspect the value at each step to decide how to move further. console.log [MDN] and console.dir [MDN] help us doing this. For example (output of the Chrome console): Here we see that that data.items is an array with two elements which are both objects. In Chrome console the objects can even be expanded and inspected immediately. This tells us that data.items[1] is an object, and after expanding it we see that it has three properties, id, name and __proto__. The latter is an internal property used for the prototype chain of the object. The prototype chain and inheritance is out of scope for this answer, though. You can access it this way or Both ways are equal. Objects and arrays has a lot of built-in methods that can help you with processing data. Note: in many of the examples I'm using arrow functions. They are similar to function expressions, but they bind the this value lexically. Object.keys() returns an array of object's keys, Object.values() returns an array of object's values, and Object.entries() returns an array of object's keys and corresponding values in a format [key, value].   It's very convenient to iterate the result of Object.entries() with a for-of loop and destructuring assignment. For-of loop lets you iterate array elements. The syntax is for (const element of array) (we can replace const with var or let, but it's better to use const if we don't intend to modify element). Destructuring assignment lets you extract values from an array or an object and assign them to variables. In this case const [key, value] means that instead of assigning the [key, value] array to element, we assign the first element of that array to key and the second element to value. It is equivalent to this: As you can see, destructuring makes this a lot simpler. The every() method returns true if the specified callback function returns true for every element of the array. The some() method returns true if the specified callback function returns true for some (at least one) element.  The find() methods returns the first element which satisfies the provided callback function. The filter() method returns an array of all elements which satisfies the provided callback function.  The map() method returns an array with the results of calling a provided callback function on the array elements.  The reduce() method reduces an array to a single value by calling the provided callback function with two elements.  The reduce() method takes an optional second parameter, which is the initial value. This is useful when the array on which you call reduce() can has zero or one elements. For example, if we wanted to create a function sum() which takes an array as an argument and returns the sum of all elements, we could write it like that:  In case you're trying to access an item from the example structure by id or name, without knowing it's position in the array, the easiest way to do it would be to use underscore.js library: From my experience, using higher order functions instead of for or for..in loops results in code that is easier to reason about, and hence more maintainable. Just my 2 cents. At times, accessing a nested object using a string can be desirable. The simple approach is the first level, for example But this is often not the case with complex json. As json becomes more complex, the approaches for finding values inside of the json also become complex. A recursive approach for navigating the json is best, and how that recursion is leveraged will depend on the type of data being searched for. If there are conditional statements involved, a json search can be a good tool to use. If the property being accessed is already known, but the path is complex, for example in this object And you know you want to get the first result of the array in the object, perhaps you would like to use However, that will cause an exception as there is no property of object with that name. The solution to be able to use this would be to flatten the tree aspect of the object. This can be done recursively. Now, the complex object can be flattened Here is a jsFiddle Demo of this approach being used. To access a nested attribute, you need to specify its name and then search through the object. If you already know the exact path, then you can hardcode it in your script like so: these also work - When you don't know the exact name before hand, or a user is the one who provides the name for you. Then dynamically searching through the data structure is required. Some suggested here that the search can be done using a for loop, but there is a very simple way to traverse a path using Array.reduce. The path is a way to say: First take the object with key items, which happens to be an array. Then take the 1-st element (0 index arrays). Last take the object with key name in that array element, which happens to be the string bar. If you have a very long path, you might even use String.split to make all of this easier - This is just plain JavaScript, without using any third party libraries like jQuery or lodash. It's simple explanation:  This question is quite old, so as a contemporary update. With the onset of ES2015 there are alternatives to get a hold of the data you require. There is now a feature called object destructuring for accessing nested objects.  The above example creates a variable called secondName from the name key from an array called items, the lonely , says skip the first object in the array. Notably it's probably overkill for this example, as simple array acccess is easier to read, but it comes in useful when breaking apart objects in general. This is very brief intro to your specific use case, destructuring can be an unusual syntax to get used to at first. I'd recommend reading Mozilla's Destructuring Assignment documentation to learn more. You could use lodash _get function: or Basically, use a dot between each descendant that unfolds underneath it and when you have object names made out of two strings, you must use the [\"obj Name\"] notation. Otherwise, just a dot would suffice; Source:  https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/accessing-nested-objects to add to this, accessing nested Arrays would happen like so: Source: https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/accessing-nested-arrays/ Another more useful document depicting the situation above:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics#Bracket_notation Property access via dot walking: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_Accessors#Dot_notation Just in case, anyone's visiting this question in 2017 or later and looking for an easy-to-remember way, here's an elaborate blog post on Accessing Nested Objects in JavaScript without being bamboozled by Cannot read property 'foo' of undefined error The easiest and the cleanest way is to use Oliver Steele's nested object access pattern With this notation, you'll never run into Cannot read property 'name' of undefined. You basically check if user exists, if not, you create an empty object on the fly. This way, the next level key will always be accessed from an object that exists or an empty object, but never from undefined. To be able to access nested arrays, you can write your own array reduce util. There is also an excellent type handling minimal library typy that does all this for you.  Accessing dynamically multi levels object. Working fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/andreitodorut/3mws3kjL/ Using JSONPath would be one of the most flexible solutions if you are willing to include a library: https://github.com/s3u/JSONPath (node and browser) For your use case the json path would be: so: I prefer JQuery. It's cleaner and easy to read. If you are looking for one or more objects that meets certain criteria you have a few options using query-js There's also a single and a singleOrDefault they work much like firstand firstOrDefaultrespectively. The only difference is that they will throw if more than one match is found. for further explanation of query-js you can start with this post Which is a JavaScript library that provides a whole mess of useful functional programming helpers without extending any built-in objects. Old question but as nobody mentioned lodash (just underscore). In case you are already using lodash in your project, I think an elegant way to do this in a complex example: Opt 1 same as: Opt 2 The difference between the first and second option is that in the Opt 1 if you have one of the properties missing (undefined) in the path you don't get an error, it returns you the third parameter. For array filter lodash has _.find() but I'd rather use the regular filter(). But I still think the above method _.get() is super useful when working with really complex data. I faced in the past really complex APIs and it was handy! I hope it can be useful for who's looking for options to manipulate really complex data which the title implies. I don't think questioner just only concern one level nested object, so I present the following demo to demonstrate how to access the node of deeply nested json object. All right, let's find the node with id '5'.  In 2020, you can use @babel/plugin-proposal-optional-chaining it is very easy to access nested values in an object. https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-optional-chaining https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining In below deep(data,key) function, you can use arbitrary key string - in your case items[1].name (you can use array notation [i] at any level) - if key is invalid then undefined is return.  You can use the syntax jsonObject.key to access the the value. And if you want access a value from an array, then you can use the syntax jsonObjectArray[index].key. Here are the code examples to access various values to give you the idea.  jQuery's grep function lets you filter through an array:  Here is an answer using object-scan. When accessing a single entry, this answer doesn't really provide much benefit over vanilla javascript. However interacting with multiple fields at the same time this answer can be more performant. Here is how you could interact with a single field  Disclaimer: I'm the author of object-scan and here is how you could interact with multiple fields at the same time  Disclaimer: I'm the author of object-scan And here is how one could find an entity in a deeply nested object searching by id (as asked in comment)  Disclaimer: I'm the author of object-scan If you're trying to find a path in a JSON string, you can dump your data into https://jsonpathfinder.com and click on the GUI elements.

The functions returns 0. While all the 3 enums have only few elements so by default the enum types will be int types so I am expecting the function to return 1 but it returns 0. Do I need to modify the test condition or the enum arrays so that the function returns 1? You write ... While all the 3 enums have only few elements so by default the enum types will be int types ... but although enum types are integer types, it is not safe to conclude that they are compatible specifically with int.  On the contrary, the language specification says this: Each enumerated type shall be compatible with char, a signed integer type, or an unsigned integer type. The choice of type is implementation-defined, but shall be capable of representing the values of all the members of the enumeration. (C17 6.7.2.2/4) None of your enums has too many constants or constants with too large a value for them to be made compatible with char, so the full range of types is available for the implementation to choose. Do I need to modify the test condition or the enum arrays so that the function returns 1? There are no arrays there, but I suppose you mean the enumerator lists in the enum definitions.  There is no way to ensure that your enum types will be compatible with int in every C implementation, but you have a fairly good chance of getting int-size enums by specifying a range of enumerator values that require at least that large a representation.  For example, In principle, an implementation could use some kind of compressed representation with that, but I am not aware of any implementation going to such lengths to save space. Enums are problematic because an enumerated type, the variable itself, can have implementation-defined size as long as it is large enough to hold all specified items. Something like enum smallchoices { sa, sb, sc }; can fit inside a 8 bit integer type, so it's rather common that embedded systems compilers in particular optimize it down to 8 bits. So your \"sanity test\" is wrong, it's in conflict with the C standard. On the other hand, enumerated constants, these: sa, sb, sc, are guaranteed to always be of type int. Thus if you need portable code with fixed size enums (or just 32 bit aligned chunks), then you shouldn't use enum for the actual storage, but one of the intn_t types from stdint.h (likely uint32_t in this case). You can still use typedef enum etc to create a list of constants, but just don't use that type for storage if deterministic size matters. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2822": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69548052/javascript-tax-calculator-input-boxes-not-functioning", "Javascript Tax Calculator Input boxes not Functioning this is a homework assignment in which I am supposed to write the JavaScript function (calculate) to calculate and display sales tax and total upon hitting the calculate button.

SecuriKey allows any old apartment building intercom to be controlled from an app. Users can create entry codes that work once, up to a certain date, or are instantly revokable. There is no need for any new or additional hardware \u2013 it works with the buildings existing intercom. Currently, the app is using Stripe for subscriptions and it was initially approved 2 months ago for the App Store. I pushed an update a few weeks ago and Apple Rejected it because I am not using In-App Purchase (IAP). I submit an appeal, mentioning that we offer a consumable service that takes place outside of the app (guideline 3.1.3(e)), it is effectively a \"Reader\" app since we provide VoIP numbers to our customers (guideline 3.1.3(f)), and SecuriKey requires hardware to function \u2013 that is, it will not work without a physical intercom (guideline 3.1.4). Additionally, we do ship physical goods to our customers (NFC tags and Security Signs) monthly and require monthly service personnel to service the building using the physical goods for our own back end workflow. A lot of back and forth has occurred between the review team and at the time of this post, the app is still being reviewed by the board. I thoroughly believe we fit within all of the mentioned IAP exception guidelines \u2013 but that's a conversation for another day. As I wait, I began to delve into using IAP for this product. I was able to jerry-rig the IAP platform to feed Stripe the necessary data through the notifications apple sends when a subscription is made, and I am able to create an account and collect a payment. But there's one huge oversight. This is a cross-platform app. Meaning, roommates or family members who use different mobile operating systems, can be logged into the same account. A user may sign up from the iPhone but his/her roommate/family member may have an android that also has access to the service under the same account. Thus, the android user will not be able to change the IAP subscription plan from the android side of the service. Furthermore, a web-portal is being developed, and using IAP will not allow us to modify the subscription via the web-portal either. Has anyone ever dealt with something like this? How can you use IAP for a cross-platform application and allow android users to modify the subscription (Whether it be canceling, upgrading, or downgrading)? If Apple says you have to use IAPs, you should leverage IAPs and not a payment service provider like Stripe. I'm confused with what I was able to jerry-rig the IAP platform to feed Stripe the necessary data through the notifications apple sends when a subscription is made, means but does not sound like the right thing to do. Thus, the android user will not be able to change the IAP subscription plan from the android side of the service. Furthermore, a web-portal is being developed, and using IAP will not allow us to modify the subscription via the web-portal either Your user will have to use Apple's Platform (i.e. an Apple device that they are signed into) to cancel the IAP subscription. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2824": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69548048/how-to-manage-error-reporting-as-a-side-effect-in-jetpack-compose", "How to manage error reporting as a side effect in Jetpack Compose I'm playing around with Jetpack Compose and I think I have a side effect in my composable, which tries to send an error report when it finds an unexpected value.

In this case you can use LaunchedEffect: LaunchedEffect lambda will only be executed once when added to the compose view tree, including removing and reattaching in case your state takes a valid value and then reverting to a non-valid one. Also, by specifying state as a key, you can re-run it if two different invalid states appear in sequence.

I want to allow user scripting/programming of server-side programs.  While I am seeking advice on serverfault regarding how to mitigate security risks on the system administration side of things, I am also wondering what languages provide facilities to restrict them from executing dangerous code? While I'll discuss Lua and Tcl, I am very interested in other options as well; I love to learn about new languages, and having a selection to choose from would be great from the standpoint of being able to pick one that would be ideal for users. Lua: Lua has a sandbox capability. As an example of an issue that a developer may need to consider for Lua, there is this page regarding Lua bytecode as a vector of attack. Tcl: Tcl has the ability to create \"safe interpreters\": https://www.tcl-lang.org/man/tcl8.6/TclCmd/interp.htm#M12 If the -safe switch is specified (or if the parent interpreter is a safe interpreter), the new child interpreter will be created as a safe interpreter with limited functionality; otherwise the child will include the full set of Tcl built-in commands and variables. I haven't been able to find much information regarding issues a developer may need to consider for Tcl. What are other languages with similar capabilities and do they have any proven known issues in this regard? In Tcl with basic safe interpreters, all operations that touch the outside world at all (open, exec, source, load, socket, etc.) are profiled out of the safe interpreter \u2014 the commands that provide them are hidden (a special kind of naming that means that they cannot be accessed from inside the interpreter) \u2014 so it's trivially provable that by default there's only possible problems due to excessive memory or CPU use. But what about how to actually let the safe interpreters do something useful? Well, that's possible because every safe interpreter has a parent interpreter that is fully-enabled, and which can create inter-interpreter aliases: commands in the safe interpreter which invoke a defined stand-in in the controlling parent. It's good to think of those as being analogous to a system call (though much cheaper!) and they can provide exactly the operations that the application wishes to support. Of course, some substantial care is required if you take an argument to those commands that you intend to treat as a filename or network address, but you at least know that you only ever get poked at in ways that you expect. (The usual way to avoid problems with filenames is to only support abstract handles \u2014 simple names defined by the parent \u2014 that have no meaning other than \u201cyou can use this in these operations\u201d. That's pretty much how Tcl's I/O channel handles work.) There's also the full Safe Tcl built-in package, which provides a simulated full interpreter in a safe interpreter and which allows defined profiles of what can be accessed (e.g., just reading packages from a defined local package repository). I'm less certain that that's correct; it is quite complicated internally. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2827": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69548044/display-random-images-with-angular", "Display random images with angular Please I asked a question about displaying random images and look at my code and still I cannot get the images display randomly when I clicked the button: This is the error message im getting after I did made the changes you suggested  Just have a member that you can change with your function, and use that member in your template: In template You don't even need the array if you have a fixed number of images in your resource folder. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2828": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69548043/how-to-access-variable-values-outside-for-loop-and-display-to-user-in-dialogflow", "How to access variable values outside for loop and display to user in dialogflow using nodejs Conversation Flow: User:hi,I want to book a hotel.

P.S.: P1 can be anywhere in the JSON. If no method can do this, can you tell me how to iterate through the JSON? As I said in my other answer, I don't think there is a way of finding all values associated with the \"P1\" key without iterating over the whole structure. However I've come up with even better way to do that which came to me while looking at @Mike Brennan's answer to another JSON-related question How to get string objects instead of Unicode from JSON? The basic idea is to use the object_hook parameter that json.loads() accepts just to watch what is being decoded and check for the sought-after value. Note: This will only work if the representation is of a JSON object (i.e. something enclosed in curly braces {}), as in your sample. (Python 3) output: I had the same issue just the other day. I wound up just searching through the entire object and accounted for both lists and dicts. The following snippets allows you to search for the first occurrence of a multiple keys. It returns a dict with the keys being the keys searched for. Haystack is expected to be a Python object already, so you have to do json.loads before passing it to deep_search. Any comments for optimization are welcomed! My approach to this problem would be different. As JSON doesn't allow depth first search, so convert the json to a Python Object, feed it to an XML decoder and then extract the Node you are intending to search Using json to convert the json to Python objects and then going through recursively works best.  This example does include going through lists. Converting the JSON to Python and recursively searching is by far the easiest: (where a is the string) The example code ignores arrays.  Adding that is left as an exercise. Bearing in mind that json is simply a string, using regular expressions with look-ahead and look-behind can accomplish this task very quickly. Typically, the json would have been extracted from a request to external api, so code to show how that would work has been included but commented out. I don't think there's any way of finding all values associated with P1 without iterating over the whole structure. Here's a recursive way to do it that first deserializes the JSON object into an equivalent Python object. To simplify things most of the work is done via a recursive private nested function. You could also use a generator to search the object after json.load().

The class I have below is the BattleSequence class and the variable I'd like to call \"playerHealth\" is in the Player class. How would I go about doing this? You don't show your other class here, but I'm assuming that you're trying to do something like: In order to do that, you'd have to actually create an instance of SomeClass: Here's an analogy: suppose that you want to eat some chocolate chip cookies. You definitely cannot just look in the recipe and grab some - you actually have to use the recipe to make some cookies. I'm oversimplifying here a bit (for example, by ignoring static variables), but that's basically how classes work - classes by themselves don't really do anything. They're just a \"recipe\" for making objects. The variables in the class don't actually exist until you actually make the object. A few quick notes: you may want to consider using getters and setters rather than accessing the field directly. Also, you'll obviously want to use more meaningful names than SomeClass and myClass like I used here. Pick something that makes sense for your program instead of the generic names I used. you can create a getter for your variable or make it static and access it like <class-name>.playerHealth site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2858": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69547972/get-the-name-of-five-continent-from-api", "Get the name of five continent from API I need a free api for get of the five continent names.

So, the thing is the following. I have a dataframe with some elements that have a particular value under a certain condition, and I want to make a bar plot where each element is on the X-axis, their corresponding value is on the Y-axis, and the values for each condition are one next to each other over the respective element. Also I would like to color the bars with a different color for each element, but the same color for each value of the same element. Not all elements has values for all conditions. This is not the data I'm using, but I tried to make a minimal code as follows: The output is the following: Output I know that the \"palette\" argument will only color for \"hue\", but I left like that in purpose for this example. Also, the \"color\" argument would color all the bars and that's not what I'm looking for. What I want is something like this: Desired_Output Notice that also the elements with a single bar has its bar centered, instead of having the bar to the left with the 2 slots for the missing condition being empty. But I guess that fixing that could be too much to ask haha. Also, the position of the label, or the way of labeling each condition could be like that, different or even missing, I'm not that picky with that. What I really want is to be able to color the bars for each element with the same color, and place the values for each element together. I've read about plotting directly from pandas, or that seaborn is an overkill for a plot like this so I should be using matplotlib only instead and whatnot, but I've not been able to find a solution for this. I don't know if maybe the problem is that I should re-structure the dataframe in someway, or what. Can someone offer me any guidance over here? Thanks! I am not too much a fan of these prepackaged plot modules such as seaborn. There may be a way to do this with seaborn more readily. Here however is a matplotlib native approach. The trick is to compute where the centers are of your labels. Then merely iterating through the conditions and keeping track of where the centers are. The results:  I leave if up to you to figure out how to get rid of the the gaps in between the conditions that aren't there at the Names labels. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2864": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69547963/in-sharepoint-modern-how-can-i-create-clickable-images-that-change-content-on-t", "In SharePoint Modern, how can I create clickable images that change content on the same page?

Assuming you want to format all cells in column G you would use: Now, if you have blanks that are caused by a formula ISBLANK will not suffice, so you would need to use something more like: CF has a tendency to act a little wonky, so after you enter the formula open the CF dialog back up and make sure it didn't add any extra quotes or anything, and verify your \"Applies To\" range is still correct. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2889": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69547917/i-am-trying-to-accomplish-a-substring-search-in-python", "I am trying to accomplish a substring search in python [duplicate] The following should be matched: can I do: \".*123\" ? Yes, you can. That should work. Yes that will work, though note that . will not match newlines unless you pass the DOTALL flag when compiling the expression: Use the pattern . to match any character once, .* to match any character zero or more times,  .+ to match any character one or more times. The most common way I have seen to encode this is with a character class whose members form a partition of the set of all possible characters. Usually people write that as [\\s\\S] (whitespace or non-whitespace), though [\\w\\W], [\\d\\D], etc. would all work. There are lots of sophisticated regex testing and development tools, but if you just want a simple test harness in Java, here's one for you to play with: Now you can easily add new testcases and try new patterns. Have fun exploring regex. .* and .+ are for any chars except for new lines. Just in case, you would wanted to include new lines, the following expressions might also work for those languages that double escaping is required such as Java or C++: for zero or more times, or for one or more times. Double escaping is not required for some languages such as, C#, PHP, Ruby, PERL, Python, JavaScript: If you wish to explore the expression, it's been explained on the top right panel of regex101.com. If you'd like, you can also watch in this link, how it would match against some sample inputs. jex.im visualizes regular expressions:  No, * will match zero-or-more characters. You should use +, which matches one-or-more instead. This expression might work better for you: [A-Z]+123 Specific Solution to the example problem:- Try [A-Z]*123$ will match 123, AAA123, ASDFRRF123. In case you need at least a character before 123 use [A-Z]+123$. General Solution to the question (How to match \"any character\" in the regular expression): Try the regex .{3,}. This will match all characters except a new line. [^] should match any character, including newline. [^CHARS] matches all characters except for those in CHARS. If CHARS is empty, it matches all characters. JavaScript example: I work this Not always dot is means any char.

FIDDLE: https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/4D6VfqysPCWhQnh8zaFBps/2 You only select columns from table active_pairs to begin with. After joining on a.pair_id = b.id, the condition a.pair_id IS NULL is only true if there is no matching row in table order_splits_config AS a, which is more efficiently formulated as NOT EXISTS instead of the FULL JOIN. As for b.id IS NULL AND b.exchange_active = 'true': again, b.id can only be NULL for rows of a where no matching b is found - in which case b.exchange_active can never be true. So the clause effectively eliminates all rows of a that were just added by the FULL JOIN and which would show up in the result as all NULL values since there are only columns from b. In short: don't FULL JOIN to begin with. If active_pairs.pair is defined UNIQUE, it boils down to: If active_pairs.pair is not defined UNIQUE, the simple solution is with DISTINCT ON: db<>fiddle here From each set of duplicates on pair, you get an arbitrary pick. For a deterministic pick, define what to pick and add an ORDER BY clause accordingly. Example: to get the one with the smallest id, add: Also adds a sort order to the so far unsorted result. If order_splits_config isn't trivially small, have an index on (pair_id) to make this fast. There may be much faster solutions for a big active_pairs table, depending on undisclosed information, mostly the cardinality of column pair (how many duplicate values).

As ODI typically requires vnc access, you will have the following type of options to configure ODI: ODI in a public subnet with public IP and using a routing table that has an internet gateway. This subnet, if in the same VCN, should have a security list configured to allow traffic inbound to the subnet of the ATP/ADW instances. Configure ODI in the same private subnet as a bastion instance, to create vnc connections and forward from the bastion instance to the local client (to access ODI Studio). ODI and the database will reside in the same subnet and the security list should only allow routing of database traffic in the private subnet. Similar to option 1 but with the use of a different VCN.

I need some help in understanding about casting an array to the generic type. The following code is from the book Introduction to Java Programming by Y. Daniel Liang Chapter 19. The code is shortened to show where I'm missing understanding. GenericMatrix.java: IntegerMatrix.java: TestIntegerMatrix.java: My understanding is that since I'm declaring my instance of GenericMatrix as an Integer, then the addMatrix method should return an Integer[][] (2 dimensional array of type Integer). This is why I declared m3 variable as such. When I compile this code it compiles without any error. But when I run it I get the error that Number can't ve concerted to Integer. if I change m3 to Number[][] everything works. From what I understood the main gain of generics is to avoid this issue. That the compiler would catch this. But what I wonder even more is why wouldn't it return an an Integer[][]. As per the book you can't create an array of a generic type. to circumvent this problem you cast it to the generic type. But fron I'm seeing here the cast doesn't work Exert from book: \"Restriction 2: Cannot Use new E[] You cannot create an array using a generic type parameter. For example, the following  statement is wrong: E[] elements = new E[capacity]; You can circumvent this limitation by creating an array of the Object type then casting it  to E[], as follows: E[] elements = (E[])new Object[capacity];\" Why wouldn't my code instantiate the returned result array as an Integer since E is instantiated as an Integer?

Alternatively you can use .Delete instead and utilize the Shift argument then. Secondly you didn't specify the sheet for your Range so it by default used the Active Sheet. Thirdly, you're comparing a single cell value to a range which needs to be done either by a find command or looping.

Given the following data structure: I have this function to delink a node in case it meets a X condition and then link it to another linked list such that I have a linked list with all the delinked nodes. It works since after call the function, if I try to traverse the new linked list it prints out the last delinked node. The issue is that: It's only the last delinked node. I can't seem to think of a way of linking the delinked nodes together. Then there is the other issue of setting the last node->nextvalue to NULL. Without writing code in an answer (for now..): What do I need to use in order to solve this in the best possible way? More aux variables...some pattern I might be forgetting...any hints? Some issues: You need to distinguish between the first node to add to the result list and the next ones: only the first time do you need to assign to *registerDeleted, as that is the head node of that list, but the other times you need to extend that list, which does not impact the value of *registerDeleted. So you need a helper variable that will point to the tail of that result list. The condition register->next->next != NULL suggests that the tail node could never be candidate for deletion. This is probably not what you intended. Don't forget to set the last next pointer in the result list to NULL. If you cannot figure it out, here is a hidden solution: void delinkNodes(node * register, node ** registerDeleted) {     if (register == NULL) return;     node * currentNode = register->next;     node * tailNode = NULL;     while (currentNode != NULL) {         if (helperCheckCondition(currentNode)) {             printf(\"De-linking node!\\n\");             \u200bregister->next = currentNode->next;             if (tailNode == NULL) { // First time only                 tailNode = *registerDeleted = currentNode;            \u200b } else {                \u200b tailNode = tailNode-next = currentNode;            \u200b }             tailNode->next = NULL; // Make sure the end of the list is marked!        \u200b }        \u200b else {             \u200bregister = currentNode;        \u200b }         currentNode = register->next;    \u200b } } site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2925": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69547860/output-parameter-in-stored-procedure-binding-in-python", "Output parameter in stored procedure binding in Python I have a stored procedure which has input as well as output parameters, I am trying to figure out how to bind the output parameter: I have tried However I am trying to understand how I can get the parameter as output in result site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2926": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69547859/writing-unit-tests-for-python-api-rate-limiter-tdd-approach", "Writing unit tests for Python API rate limiter (TDD approach) I'm trying to teach myself TDD as I've never learned it and am using a practice problem.

I had to fix the inversion of the y axis by changing int offset = (y * monitor_width + x) * 4; to int offset = ((monitor_height - 1 - y) * monitor_width + x) * 4; this fixed the pixel location issue because it was showing black where I expected black. However, the colors were still strong. I tested by trying to get the color of known pixels. I noticed every blue pixel had a very high R value and every red pixel had a very high blue value. That's when I compared with an existing tool I had and found out that the red and blue values seem to be switched in every pixel. At first I thought it was backwards or a byte alignment issue, but I also verified in a clustering of pixels that aren't uniform to make sure it's picking the right position of pixel, and it did perfectly well, just with the colors switched. Full simplified code below (originally my tool was getting my cursor position and printing the pixel color via hotkey press; this is a simplified version that gets one specific point). The output of this will be debug: (12, 12): (199, 76, 133) even though another program has verified the colors are actually (133, 76, 199). I can easily fix this in my code by flipping the y axis and switching each R and B value and the program will work perfectly well. However, I am just baffled by how this happened and whether there's a more elegant fix. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2969": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69547763/location-service-off-an-ios-app-crashes-on-live-testflight", "Location Service Off an ios app crashes on live/testflight We have an ios app build using react native and ruby as back end.

To find out if string1 is a substring of string2, you need to make sure each letter in string1 is there in string2 the same number of times\". I really don't have any idea that I can come up with except the /find method on Python. It would be great if you could help. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "2991": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69547725/downsampling-data-frome-25hz-to-10hz", "Downsampling data frome 25hz to 10hz I have some time series data sampled at 25hz (25 samples per second) and I want to go down to 10 samples per second.

The first one is what index object do I use for the times? is it https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.TimedeltaIndex.seconds.html ? The second is, after doing so, how do I actually go about resampling to get both time_in_seconds and data_vals at the new 10hz. The documentation on the resample function contains much more useful information. Since time_in_secods measure times since some event, a TimedeltaIndex is the most appropriate here. Here's how to resample by averaging the original data points: There are other resampling methods, such as min, max or weighted mean.

Use \"w\" flag for writing, instead \"a\" to append. Open the files in binary mode if this is running on Window. Use fread and fwrite instead of fgets and fprintf.

The thing you were doing wrong is just the whole format of the code These are just used 1 time and you just used them as divs What you should have done was like this - HTML CSS Your syntax of writing the code was very wrong and I think you would have wanted the heading h1 inside the div like this- and not leaving the div empty for no reason at all After all this the main thing due to which you were not able to center it through text-align: center; was, you just had to take width as 100vw and not 100% means you are taking the width of the element in respect of the screen means- if you are viewing your website through a desktop whose width = 600px then your <h1 class=\"center\">Denied</h1> width will be equal to the width of the screen which is 600px At Last I would suggest you see the syntax of the html and css properly A Quick Tip - if you are using VSCode for writing code you can just write ! on an empty HTML file and it will automatically write the HTML template with `head, body,HTML and all that stuff. You have pasted your html code twice in your answer and this is making a mess to understand your code. Although your question is quite simple and I have answered in as simplest way as I can.

The numbers need to be formatted so that the overall file format is essentially fixed-width. Use of Numpy, SciPy, Pandas, or other libraries is acceptable. Motivation: This fixed-width file format is extremely common in earthquake ground-motion time history datasets. Certain software programs that utilize ground motions as input only take files of this exact format. An quick and elegant answer on how to write ordinate values from an equally-spaced ground motion time histories into this format will serve the geophysics community. Sample Dataset: Expected Text File Output: Attempt: Attempt Output: We can get convert a float to a scientific notation string using the decimal module using that we can convert a float to scientific string notation of fixed string length as follows however if you are not expecting numbers that are larger than 1e+100 or smaller than 1e-100 you can simply the function to the following we can than write all the scientific numbers to a list adding a space after each one and a \\n to every fifth.

I'm using GitHub with TortoiseGit. Currently i just can add files to ignore with \"Delete and add to ignorelist\". I have a small website project which runs at several customers. Files like the config-file should be inside the repo/branch but just the initial file with dummy content. When working with on my local i want to ignore changes inside of these files cause i have my own ones and other project workers also. How i can achieve that? I already treid to add the files manually to the .gitignore but it seems like TortoiseGit doesnt interest the content of that file. This is a specific instance of the general question, \u201cHow do I ignore changes to tracked files?\u201d which is answered in the Git FAQ: Git doesn\u2019t provide a way to do this. The reason is that if Git needs to overwrite this file, such as during a checkout, it doesn\u2019t know whether the changes to the file are precious and should be kept, or whether they are irrelevant and can safely be destroyed. Therefore, it has to take the safe route and always preserve them. It\u2019s tempting to try to use certain features of git update-index, namely the assume-unchanged and skip-worktree bits, but these don\u2019t work properly for this purpose and shouldn\u2019t be used this way. However, the FAQ entry does go on to propose a solution for configuration files where you need to modify the data: If your goal is to modify a configuration file, it can often be helpful to have a file checked into the repository which is a template or set of defaults which can then be copied alongside and modified as appropriate. This second, modified file is usually ignored to prevent accidentally committing it. To supplement the answer of bk2204: You can set the skip-worktree flag in TortoiseGit. It is available in the context menu of the files in the commit dialog. TortoiseGit comes with a feature called \"changelists\". This feature might be handy for you as you can flag a file as \"ignore-on-commit\". When flagged, this file is not autoselected any more. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "3024": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69547655/adding-up-value-from-text-box", "Adding up value from text box I have 6 text boxes in Visual Studio code 2019.

The first thing I discovered was the use of api connectors. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/add-api-connector-token-enrichment?pivots=b2c-user-flow Maybe this is my decision? But I didn't understand how to check this locally from localhost. Please share the best practices for writing such logic. As per your link, you need to use custom policies. In the link, you see e.g. \"balance\" (a custom claim) returned from the API call and added to the JWT for the RelyingParty. You don't need to convert tokens - just call the API. There are a number of options to secure your API. You can return error messages. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "3044": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69547622/django-why-getting-this-error-no-user-profile-found-matching-the-query", "Django why getting this error No user profile found matching the query I am trying to implement load more button so I am writing this view for load json data but I am not understanding why I am getting this error.

(Leetcode 740. Delete and Earn) I'm trying to understand how to solve Leetcode Problem #740: Delete and Earn I recently was given this problem as part of a pre-interview assessment and was unable to complete it in the allotted time. I've been working on it today to try and wrap my head around it, but I'm kinda spinning in circles at the moment. I've checked numerous resources, videos, tutorials, etc, but I'm working in vanilla JS and a lot of the guides are in C++, Python, or Typescript which I don't currently know. (I plan on learning Python and Typescript at minimum, but I'm working with my current set of knowledge for the time being). This is leading to confusion and frustration, as an accurate translation of sample python/c++ code, etc continues to elude me. The problem is as follows: You are given an integer array nums. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times: Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times. Example 1 Example 2 What I have so far: Provided Python Solution This is what I've tried to model my code off of, but I don't actually know Python syntax so I'm sure I'm missing something. I really don't understand at all why this code isn't working, and I've even gone as far as to run sample cases step by step. Please help me understand how to do this so I can get a job! Many thanks I figured it out! The problem is twofold. Bug Number One First, shoutout to David Eisenstat for catching the bug in my makeDict() function. The incorrect line of code reads: Whereas the correct syntax is as follows: or alternatively The issue comes from how postfix vs prefix increment operators work in Javascript. From the MDN docs: If used postfix, with operator after operand (for example, x++), the increment operator increments and returns the value before incrementing. If used prefix, with operator before operand (for example, ++x), the increment operator increments and returns the value after incrementing. Bug Number Two The second issue comes from my initial guard clauses. I think this was a remnant from when I was sorting the provided array at the very start, but even then automatically selecting the last element doesn't really make any sense. I deleted this line and, combined with the adjustment to the previous makeDict() function, the code passed all the provided tests. My working solution is provided below. Open to any suggestions as to how to improve the code for both readability, or efficiency. Appreciate the help! One bug in your existing code is that will not sort numbers in order - see here. Another bug is that your algorithm doesn't have any backtracking - you don't want to greedily choose 3 when given [3, 4, 4, 4]. I think the best way to approach this is to understand that it's only strings of consecutive numbers in the input that need to be considered. For example, given Separate it out into all the consecutive strings of integers: Then decide the optimal picks for each sequence. You can't just pick all odd numbers or all even numbers in the sequence, because that would fail to pick, eg, 1 and 4 for [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]. The best approach I can see is to use a recursive function: when checking a sequence, getBestSequenceSum, starting with N, return the maximum of: to adequately cover all possibilities. There may be more efficient algorithms, but this is relatively simple and intuitive.  The number of calculations could be reduced somewhat by changing the { num, count: 0 } objects to a single number instead, but that would be more difficult to understand when reading the code. You could also reduce the number of calculations by caching already-optimized sequences so as not to recalculate them multiple times, but that'd make the code significantly longer. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "3047": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69547615/uncaught-syntaxerror-unexpected-token-o-in-json-at-position-1-i-have-this-excep", "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token o in JSON at position 1 I have this exception but I don\u00b4t know what is this some errors on Chrome after run my jsp, I don't know what happens: This is the code in js but, the but I can't understand the mistake. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "3048": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69547612/list-within-function-not-returning-back-as-iterable", "List within function not returning back as iterable I'm having issues seeing why I'm getting this error TypeError: 'function' object is not iterable when the list should be iterable since it got the information of the size in earlier portions of the code site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "3049": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69547611/convert-to-decimal-when-using-csvhelper", "Convert to decimal when using CsvHelper When I try to use CsvHelper to parse the below CSV, I get a \"conversion cannot be performed\" error (full error is below).

There are two options you can use here: Do you have the ability to modify the CSV file?

For example, with all your code in a single file, that may look like: Please note that I added the JsonSerializer.Serialize(payer); in the foreach loop within the Main method so that you can view the JSON result from the console. I added in two custom converters (CustomBooleanConverter and CustomDecimalConverter). The payer class is then updated to have attributes added to the LensBespokePrice and CareOnly properties. Additionally, you didn't have an attribute on CareOnly for false values and while not required is a good practice. To clarify why this is happening only in your foreach loop and not var records = csv.GetRecords<Payer>(); is because the values aren't actually converted into your payer class until the records are enumerated. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "3050": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69547610/need-the-date-from-a-table-and-populate-a-datetimepicker-with-the-date-from-the", "Need the date from a table and populate a datetimepicker with the date from the table I have tried so many different ways to do this and none of them seem to work.

Here is a simple attempt to match the mean of the inner region with that of the outer region.

BACKGROUND I am building a basic MFC application which helps me to run tests. The GUI is extremely spartaic. One button to START and another button to STOP the test, plus a static text object to display a few letters and digits indicating what stage the test is performing. This has been working satisfactorily for weeks. I would find it useful if my application also made a video screen recording while the test is performed. The big plan is to compile FFmpeg library function calls into the code to implement this capability, but this will certainly take me weeks to learn, try and complete. In the meantime, a quick but sufficient solution is to call a precompiled ffmpeg.exe from a downloaded Windows binary build. I added code to the ::OnBnClickedButtonStarttest() method to call ffmpeg.exe via CreateProcess(). This is working fine. The FFmpeg screen recording process starts in a new console window and does its intended job very well. When I select that console window and press Ctrl+C, the recording stops and I have the desired video file. I also added code to the ::OnBnClickedButtonStoptest() method to send the required Ctrl+C to the STDIN of the ffmpeg.exe process and finish recording when the STOP button is clicked. This is also working fine. MOST OF THE TIME. These two portions of my source code are based on the example published at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/creating-a-child-process-with-redirected-input-and-output by Microsoft. PROBLEM Stopping the screen recording process MOST OF THE TIME means that IT DOES NOT ALWAYS STOP. There are times when the solution does not work. And I am unable to find any reason why the same solution that works most of the time, happens to fail on other times. Eventually I would prefer to hide the FFmpeg console window and let it work behind the scene, but that would require a reliable way to stop the child process, and my current code proves to be not working reliably. Note: there is a #define BUFSIZE 128 line at the top of the source code. Although sending a single Ctrl+C (0x03) should stop the ffmpeg process, I send a little more input to be sure. Still, for some reason I have to send the above WriteFile instruction twice, in order to actually see the process stop. I do not know why. This does not concern me much though, as long as the second time it does work. What does concern me is the fact that there are times when the child process does not stop. No matter how many times I send it the above WriteFile line. I found another promising example. This time without anonymous pipes -which I suspect to be the source of the unreliable behaviour. https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/c-c-c-console-redirection-with-sockets-win32.62350/ This appear to use a named channel of its own to access the standard input of the child process. I prefer this approach. Unfortunately, it is not only that it does not work, it also does not compile. The Socket thisSocket; line refers to a non-existing type. There is no such type as Socket, not with an uppercase S and lowercase ocket. I tried to use all uppercase SOCKET type in its place, which does compile, but an accordingly modified WriteFile((HANDLE)thisSocket, chBuf, dwNumOfBytesToWrite, &dwWritten, NULL); line always returns FAILURE, and does not stop the child process. To make my investigation more difficult, a large number of internet search hits take me to WINSOCK related topics instead. Did I miss something? What would be the reliable way of sending a Ctrl+C to the ffmpeg.exe process, in order to tactfully ask it to finish recording? Mind you, I can brutally kill the FFmpeg console window via TerminateProcess(g_ffmpeg_process_handle, 0), but that does not always allow the child to properly close the video file, resulting a damaged screen recording. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "3056": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69547599/return-the-data-from-column-using-powershell", "Return the Data from Column Using PowerShell When I export the $dt to a CSV - it shows in 1.A of Excel = 1 and in 2.A = 2.

I know it is the sort that is causing the issue because when I remove sort, it returns perfectly. Why is this happening here? How can I fix? Try this query instead. What does it yield? match query performs full-text search. It means that it analyzes the provided text producing tokens that will be used  when doing actual matching against the document field. Unless you defined a custom search analyzer for ProcessId field, Elasticsearch will use standard analyzer here. You can verify what tokens it produces for \"from-cn\" text using Analyze API, in this case: The response: You can see that it produces two tokens: \"from\" and \"cn\". So the documents having only one of them will also match the query. In your case, I believe, they simply fell out of the first 100 results that you requested, so you don't see them when searching without custom sort. When you don't use custom sorting, documents are sorted by score and the documents that are more relevant to the query are higher on the list. In your case, documents matching both tokens will have higher score than those matching only one. But with custom sorting you don't rely on the score anymore, so less relevant documents can be higher.

The Swift book says that \"to prevent strong reference cycles, delegates are declared as weak references.\" Say the class parameterizes a struct with that delegate Should the delegate property in the struct also be marked with weak? You want the object that owns the delegate to be using a weak reference to its delegate, so in your case, ExampleView. The fact that you've declared a reference to the delegate in your View Controller doesn't actually serve a purpose here, unless you planned on using it outside of the viewDidLoad() block. But you can already do that anyway, since you can reference self any time. You get this out of the box anyway, because that VC conforms to the SomeDelegate protocol, so you can just use self. The book is suggesting you use a weak reference to self here because you don't want to retain anything once self no longer exists; by making this a weak reference, the delegate is destroyed once it is no longer needed. There's very little reason you would ever want to reference the delegate from ExampleView in the controller directly anyway, since the delegate protocol methods are now called by the delegate (the View Controller) not the view itself. But if for some reason you did, you could check that the delegate is set, and then reference it like: site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "3064": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69547584/outputting-multiple-files-in-haskell", "Outputting Multiple Files in Haskell I'm writing code that can read one or multiple files within a directory and I am having trouble having it output the contents (in my case) of both text files.

For example, my window resolution is 1600x900, and I'm using a work group size of 16x16, where each thread or invocation corresponds to a single pixel on the screen, this means that size_x = 1600/16 = 100 and size_y = 900/16 = 56.25, so I need to call As you can see, some threads in a work group may represent pixels that extend beyond the screen, so I want to return early or discard these off-screen pixels to skip the complex computation. However, my compute shader also contains a barrier() call in several places in order to synchronize local threads, I don't know how to combine them. The documentation says For any given static instance of barrier in a compute shader, all invocations within a single work group must enter it before any are allowed to continue beyond it. ...... Barriers are also disallowed after a return statement The only workaround I can think of is to fake computations for these threads, or use if-else to let them finish early in an intermediate stage between two barrier() calls.

The one with let in the body runs very slowly. The one with <- runs very fast. My question: Why? Is let causing full evaluation somehow while <- is allowing the M.lookup via Data.Map to work? fibLet isn't actually using its state very much at all! That's why it's so slow; it's essentially a very complicated way to write the classic Haskell fibonacci definition: Look carefully what's going on here: mp is the Map of currently-known results. You use evalState to run fibLet (n - 1), starting its state with mp. Then you use evalState again to run fibLet (n - 2), starting its state with mp again. This means fibLet (n - 1) and fibLet (n - 2) aren't sharing any work; each of them is using the same starting map of already known results mp, so anything that isn't already in that map is going to have to be computed by both branches. However it's actually even worse than that. Look at the type of evalState: It has no State in its return type. That means it isn't actually stateful. It does not interact with a any surrounding state; effectively it starts off a new state thread, runs it to completion1, after which the state is discarded. You can tell that really easily by looking at the type of evalState slightly differently (but equivalently): evalState turns a State s a into a simple function typed s -> a. Obviously a plain old function can't alter the implicit state of a do block its called from (that's the whole point of making statefulness explicit in the types). So that means: evalState (fibLet (n - 1)) is just a plain old function from maps to integers. It neither accesses nor affects state of any kind. So that means that after let s1 = evalState (fibLet (n - 1)) mp the state in the outer do block is still exactly equal to mp. Nothing has been saved in our state map of already computed results. So not only are we not sharing any work between the two separate recursive calls, they're not even sharing work within the deeper layers of recursion inside each call! To prove it, try running fibLet using runState instead of evalState, so you can see what the final map is: There's only a single entry in the map, added as the last step of the do block in the outermost call to fibLet, just before it returned. If you do the same thing with fibArrow you get this: You can clearly see it's memoized all the intermediate results, not just the final one. Bottom line: You don't usually want to use evalState (and similar functions like runState and execState) inside a function that's operating in the State monad. Those functions are intended for running the whole stateful computation, and so are normally run from \"outside\" a state monad context. When you happen to run them \"inside\" a state monad context, they do not interact with it; they instead receive (and return, in the case of runState and execState) state through ordinary argument passing and function return, not through the implicit state threading provided by State. If you want to make a call to a \"stateful sub-computation\" (i.e. call a State _ _ inside a function returning State _ _), then you need to bind the sub-computation as part of the outer one. The arrow statement inside do blocks does this; the let statement doesn't, it only gives a name to an ordinary expression. That's why you found yourself having to use evalState to get a result and explicitly feed mp even though you're already inside a stateful context where it should be available implicitly; the messiness of that was a hint that something wasn't right. 1 Well, it \"runs it to completion\" assuming that the result value is fully demanded. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "3083": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69547541/how-to-access-database-actions-when-atp-is-on-public-endpoint-with-an-access-con", "How to access Database Actions when ATP is on public endpoint with an access control list (ACL)?

To check the server website ssl information, you can visit: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=files.pythonhosted.org&s=151.101.1.63 In the result, you can see a line \"Certificate #2: RSA 2048 bits (SHA256withRSA) No SNI\" which means there are 2 certificates in the server, and for more explanation, you can check https://support.cpanel.net/hc/en-us/articles/360055289933-Why-is-SSLLabs-Certificate-2-RSA-2048-bits-SHA256withRSA-No-SNI-test-showing-an-error- And OpenSSL older version cannot handle SNI correctly as well, that's why your openssl command is not returning the expected result. Actually, the same command with OpenSSL 1.0.2k-fips on Oracle Linux 7, it returns: r.shared-319-default.ssl.fastly.net with OpenSSL 1.1.1 FIPS on Centos 8, it returns: *.pythonhosted.org So the issue may be related to https://www.jfrog.com/jira/browse/HAP-556 https://www.jfrog.com/jira/si/jira.issueviews:issue-html/BI-167/BI-167.html site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "3089": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69547531/custom-sf-symbol-not-rendering-hierarchical-shading", "Custom SF Symbol not rendering hierarchical shading I have a custom SF Symbol that renders with hierarchical shading when viewed in the SF Symbols 3 app, but in iOS using SwiftUI it renders as monochrome.

Different enquiry methods might have different billing calculations associated with them, and not all agents will have every billing model enabled. NHibernate has semantics with components (value objects) whereby if every property in a component is null, the component will also be null. Therefore, with the appropriate mapping, you can write if(estateAgent.EmailEnquiryBillingModel  != null) rather than having to check every individual property of the email enquiry billing model, or whether the model is valid: we either have the model or we don't. It's a simple, elegant way of checking if a particular billing model is enabled. The problem comes when you have a set within a component, such as with the phone enquiry billing model and the various opening hours. Neither the PhoneEnquiryBillingModel nor the OpeningHours are entities. These are legitimate value objects: we don't care whether the estate agent is open from this 9am on Monday or that 9am on a Monday, just that it opens at 9am on a Monday. Therefore, this feels like the semantically correct way of representing this domain model in C#. However, the fact that the PhoneEnquiryBillingModel contains a set (of ProviderOpenHours), and a set cannot be null in NHibernate, only empty, means that ProviderOpenHours will always be non-null, even if the estate agent doesn't meaningfully have that enquiry model enabled. (For more info, see: https://ayende.com/blog/4685/those-are-the-rules-even-when-you-dont-like-them). This means that you can't do a simple check like if(estateAgent.PhoneEnquiryBillingModel != null), because that object is always not-null. Therefore, for some billing models you'd be able to do a null check to see if they are enabled, but for other billing models you'd have to find an alternative way of checking, depending on whether those billing models contain a set. Effectively, you'd need to know the internal structure of a billing model to know if you could do that kind of comparison, which feels like you're breaking encapsulation and changing your domain model based on the rules of the ORM. Is there a better way of modelling this? Or a way to get NHibernate to serialize in the PhoneEnquiryBillingModel as null, if it doesn't have a phone number or any opening hours? Therefore, with the appropriate mapping, you can write if(estateAgent.EmailEnquiryBillingModel  != null) This would not be the best encapsulation in itself. Instead, you go for: and This would give better encapsulation than interrogating properties on the EstageAgent aggregate to make an assumption about the EstateAgent's capabilities.  What if you decided to change the implementation of how an EstateAgent stored this information internally?  You need to change all clients. There's nothing particularly bad about an EstateAgent performing individual property checks on its underlying value objects. However, you could go further and implement a checker method on the PhoneEnquiryBillingModel, perhaps even static to avoid the null check in EstateAgent.

To start off this whole thing I'm working with a pattern synonym defined as follows: This allows me to run multiple pattern matches across a parameter at once.  A regular as binding (@) does not allow the left hand side to be a pattern but this does. With this I make the following toy function It's not the best way to implement this I am sure, but it's a minimum working example for the behavior in question. This has a function that takes a single parameter. It matches the parameter against two patterns using the defined synonym. The first pattern matches any non-empty list and makes no bindings. The second runs the head function on the list and binds y to the result. So the question is can head cause an error or will the other pattern prevent it? The other pattern prevents it! Alright so if I do them in the other order then it should break right? Nope! It still works.  So now my question is: Is the second pattern doing anything at all?  Maybe view patterns has some sort of smart behavior where it calls the function and fails the pattern if an error occurs ... No ... it doesn't.  This fails.  Somehow (_:_) blocks the error no matter what side it's on.  Maybe ghc prefers to match destructuring patterns before view patterns?  To test this I can replace the pattern (_:_) with (reverse -> _:_).  This way it has to run a function before it can get to the destructuring. But having tested it, the new pattern doesn't change the behavior. This hypothesis can be ruled out. So maybe it's laziness?  x can't be evaluated if the list is empty so it sits in thunk and the error never occurs.   It seems to somewhat be the case.  If I replace (head -> x) with (undefined -> x) we have no change in behavior. However if I replace it with (undefined -> \"yo\"): The undefined does get evaluated.  Which seems to indicate that the pattern is forcing evaluation to compare with \"yo\".  And if I now switch the order: It isn't evaluated.  It seems that now we are short circuiting the pattern match. So the laziness hypothesis seems to make sense?  It's still very opaque to me and I would love to have someone with more experience as to the internals of ghc confirm this hypothesis. So my question is now what is going on?  Is it laziness?  How does it work? A big thanks to discord user lexi. They helped a lot in the diagnosis thus far. You are indeed observing the effect of laziness. Let's start with a much more basic example: Laziness makes f undefined return 42. This is because the variable pattern x does not require the argument to be evaluated, so undefined is never demanded. By comparison, if we used then f undefined does crash, since the pattern () requires the argument to be evaluated until it exposes the () constructor (which, in this case, means fully evaluated). Similarly, will cause f undefined to return 42, while will cause f undefined to crash, after trying to evaluate undefined so to expose the first list constructor (either : or []). We also have that makes f undefined crash: after all the pattern \"yo\" means ('y':'o':[]) so it will force undefined, trying to match it against the first :. More in detail, all the following calls will crash: Here anything can be undefined or any other string/char as needed. By comparison, all of the following calls will return 0 since the first pattern in the definition fails its match (without crashing!): Again, anything can be undefined or any other string/char as needed. This is because the pattern matching of \"yo\" is done roughly like this: Note that in each \"evaluate .. until WHNF\" point we could crash (or get stuck in an infinite computation) beacuse of bottoms. Essentially, pattern matching proceed left-to-right and stops, evaluating the input only as much as needed, and stopping as soon as the result (fail/success) is known. This will not necessarily force the full evaluation of the input. On failure, we do not even necessarily evaluate the input as deep as the pattern, if we discover an early failure point. This is indeed what happens when you write: It seems that now we are short circuiting the pattern match. Now, view patterns follow the same principle. A pattern undefined -> x will not evaluate undefined on the input since x does not need to know the result of undefined to succeed. Instead undefined -> x:xs, undefined -> [], and undefined -> \"yo\" do need to know the result, hence they will evaluate it as needed. About your examples: Here, head -> y always succeeds. On its own, it could bind y to a bottom value, but that's prevented by the leftmost _:_ pattern. Here, head -> y always succeeds. On its own, it will bind y to a bottom value, and this actually happens if the input is [], but that will not force the input, so not crash is caused so far. After that, we try the leftmost _:_ pattern, which fails. Result: failure, but no crash. Again, head -> y always succeeds, and binds y to bottom (if the input is []). The pattern matching will succeed, and the result of f'' is [ head [] ]. We can take, e.g., the length of this list, but we can not print its contents without crashing. undefined -> \"yo\" crashes, as explained above. The x:_ pattern is never tried. Here we first match x:_ and only when that succeeds we try undefined -> \"yo\". Since we call f with [], the view pattern is not tried, so it does not crash. Calling f \"a\" would instead match x:_, try the view pattern and crash. site design / logo \u00a9 2021 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under cc by-sa.                    rev\u00a02021.10.12.40432"], "3115": ["https:/stackoverflow.com/questions/69547478/how-do-i-read-pdf-files-and-extract-keywords-and-get-the-value-of-number-of-keyw", "How do I read pdf files and extract keywords and get the value of number of keywords in that file along with their page number in table form?

How can I extract the information, i.e. access a specific or multiple values (or keys)? For example: How could I access the name of the second item in items? JavaScript has only one data type which can contain multiple values: Object. An Array is a special form of object. (Plain) Objects have the form Arrays have the form Both arrays and objects expose a key -> value structure. Keys in an array must be numeric, whereas any string can be used as key in objects. The key-value pairs are also called the \"properties\". Properties can be accessed either using dot notation or bracket notation, if the property name would not be a valid JavaScript identifier name [spec], or the name is the value of a variable: For that reason, array elements can only be accessed using bracket notation: JSON is a textual representation of data, just like XML, YAML, CSV, and others. To work with such data, it first has to be converted to JavaScript data types, i.e. arrays and objects (and how to work with those was just explained). How to parse JSON is explained in the question Parse JSON in JavaScript? . How to access arrays and objects is fundamental JavaScript knowledge and therefore it is advisable to read the MDN JavaScript Guide, especially the sections A nested data structure is an array or object which refers to other arrays or objects, i.e. its values are arrays or objects. Such structures can be accessed by consecutively applying dot or bracket notation. Here is an example: Let's assume we want to access the name of the second item. Here is how we can do it step-by-step: As we can see data is an object, hence we can access its properties using dot notation. The items property is accessed as follows: The value is an array, to access its second element, we have to use bracket notation: This value is an object and we use dot notation again to access the name property. So we eventually get: Alternatively, we could have used bracket notation for any of the properties, especially if the name contained characters that would have made it invalid for dot notation usage: Most of the time when you are getting undefined, the object/array simply doesn't have a property with that name. Use console.log or console.dir and inspect the structure of object / array. The property you are trying to access might be actually defined on a nested object / array. If the property names are unknown or we want to access all properties of an object / elements of an array, we can use the for...in [MDN] loop for objects and the for [MDN] loop for arrays to iterate over all properties / elements. Objects To iterate over all properties of data, we can iterate over the object like so: Depending on where the object comes from (and what you want to do), you might have to test in each iteration whether the property is really a property of the object, or it is an inherited property. You can do this with Object#hasOwnProperty [MDN]. As alternative to for...in with hasOwnProperty, you can use Object.keys [MDN] to get an array of property names: Arrays To iterate over all elements of the data.items array, we use a for loop: One could also use for...in to iterate over arrays, but there are reasons why this should be avoided: Why is 'for(var item in list)' with arrays considered bad practice in JavaScript?. With the increasing browser support of ECMAScript 5, the array method forEach [MDN] becomes an interesting alternative as well: In environments supporting ES2015 (ES6), you can also use the for...of [MDN] loop, which not only works for arrays, but for any iterable: In each iteration, for...of directly gives us the next element of the iterable, there is no \"index\" to access or use. In addition to unknown keys, the \"depth\" of the data structure (i.e. how many nested objects) it has, might be unknown as well. How to access deeply nested properties usually depends on the exact data structure. But if the data structure contains repeating patterns, e.g. the representation of a binary tree, the solution typically includes to recursively [Wikipedia] access each level of the data structure. Here is an example to get the first leaf node of a binary tree:  A more generic way to access a nested data structure with unknown keys and depth is to test the type of the value and act accordingly. Here is an example which adds all primitive values inside a nested data structure into an array (assuming it does not contain any functions). If we encounter an object (or array) we simply call toArray again on that value (recursive call).  Since the structure of a complex object or array is not necessarily obvious, we can inspect the value at each step to decide how to move further. console.log [MDN] and console.dir [MDN] help us doing this. For example (output of the Chrome console): Here we see that that data.items is an array with two elements which are both objects. In Chrome console the objects can even be expanded and inspected immediately. This tells us that data.items[1] is an object, and after expanding it we see that it has three properties, id, name and __proto__. The latter is an internal property used for the prototype chain of the object. The prototype chain and inheritance is out of scope for this answer, though. You can access it this way or Both ways are equal. Objects and arrays has a lot of built-in methods that can help you with processing data. Note: in many of the examples I'm using arrow functions. They are similar to function expressions, but they bind the this value lexically. Object.keys() returns an array of object's keys, Object.values() returns an array of object's values, and Object.entries() returns an array of object's keys and corresponding values in a format [key, value].   It's very convenient to iterate the result of Object.entries() with a for-of loop and destructuring assignment. For-of loop lets you iterate array elements. The syntax is for (const element of array) (we can replace const with var or let, but it's better to use const if we don't intend to modify element). Destructuring assignment lets you extract values from an array or an object and assign them to variables. In this case const [key, value] means that instead of assigning the [key, value] array to element, we assign the first element of that array to key and the second element to value. It is equivalent to this: As you can see, destructuring makes this a lot simpler. The every() method returns true if the specified callback function returns true for every element of the array. The some() method returns true if the specified callback function returns true for some (at least one) element.  The find() methods returns the first element which satisfies the provided callback function. The filter() method returns an array of all elements which satisfies the provided callback function.  The map() method returns an array with the results of calling a provided callback function on the array elements.  The reduce() method reduces an array to a single value by calling the provided callback function with two elements.  The reduce() method takes an optional second parameter, which is the initial value. This is useful when the array on which you call reduce() can has zero or one elements. For example, if we wanted to create a function sum() which takes an array as an argument and returns the sum of all elements, we could write it like that:  In case you're trying to access an item from the example structure by id or name, without knowing it's position in the array, the easiest way to do it would be to use underscore.js library: From my experience, using higher order functions instead of for or for..in loops results in code that is easier to reason about, and hence more maintainable. Just my 2 cents. At times, accessing a nested object using a string can be desirable. The simple approach is the first level, for example But this is often not the case with complex json. As json becomes more complex, the approaches for finding values inside of the json also become complex. A recursive approach for navigating the json is best, and how that recursion is leveraged will depend on the type of data being searched for. If there are conditional statements involved, a json search can be a good tool to use. If the property being accessed is already known, but the path is complex, for example in this object And you know you want to get the first result of the array in the object, perhaps you would like to use However, that will cause an exception as there is no property of object with that name. The solution to be able to use this would be to flatten the tree aspect of the object. This can be done recursively. Now, the complex object can be flattened Here is a jsFiddle Demo of this approach being used. To access a nested attribute, you need to specify its name and then search through the object. If you already know the exact path, then you can hardcode it in your script like so: these also work - When you don't know the exact name before hand, or a user is the one who provides the name for you. Then dynamically searching through the data structure is required. Some suggested here that the search can be done using a for loop, but there is a very simple way to traverse a path using Array.reduce. The path is a way to say: First take the object with key items, which happens to be an array. Then take the 1-st element (0 index arrays). Last take the object with key name in that array element, which happens to be the string bar. If you have a very long path, you might even use String.split to make all of this easier - This is just plain JavaScript, without using any third party libraries like jQuery or lodash. It's simple explanation:  This question is quite old, so as a contemporary update. With the onset of ES2015 there are alternatives to get a hold of the data you require. There is now a feature called object destructuring for accessing nested objects.  The above example creates a variable called secondName from the name key from an array called items, the lonely , says skip the first object in the array. Notably it's probably overkill for this example, as simple array acccess is easier to read, but it comes in useful when breaking apart objects in general. This is very brief intro to your specific use case, destructuring can be an unusual syntax to get used to at first. I'd recommend reading Mozilla's Destructuring Assignment documentation to learn more. You could use lodash _get function: or Basically, use a dot between each descendant that unfolds underneath it and when you have object names made out of two strings, you must use the [\"obj Name\"] notation. Otherwise, just a dot would suffice; Source:  https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/accessing-nested-objects to add to this, accessing nested Arrays would happen like so: Source: https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/accessing-nested-arrays/ Another more useful document depicting the situation above:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics#Bracket_notation Property access via dot walking: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_Accessors#Dot_notation Just in case, anyone's visiting this question in 2017 or later and looking for an easy-to-remember way, here's an elaborate blog post on Accessing Nested Objects in JavaScript without being bamboozled by Cannot read property 'foo' of undefined error The easiest and the cleanest way is to use Oliver Steele's nested object access pattern With this notation, you'll never run into Cannot read property 'name' of undefined. You basically check if user exists, if not, you create an empty object on the fly. This way, the next level key will always be accessed from an object that exists or an empty object, but never from undefined. To be able to access nested arrays, you can write your own array reduce util. There is also an excellent type handling minimal library typy that does all this for you.  Accessing dynamically multi levels object. Working fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/andreitodorut/3mws3kjL/ Using JSONPath would be one of the most flexible solutions if you are willing to include a library: https://github.com/s3u/JSONPath (node and browser) For your use case the json path would be: so: I prefer JQuery. It's cleaner and easy to read. If you are looking for one or more objects that meets certain criteria you have a few options using query-js There's also a single and a singleOrDefault they work much like firstand firstOrDefaultrespectively. The only difference is that they will throw if more than one match is found. for further explanation of query-js you can start with this post Which is a JavaScript library that provides a whole mess of useful functional programming helpers without extending any built-in objects. Old question but as nobody mentioned lodash (just underscore). In case you are already using lodash in your project, I think an elegant way to do this in a complex example: Opt 1 same as: Opt 2 The difference between the first and second option is that in the Opt 1 if you have one of the properties missing (undefined) in the path you don't get an error, it returns you the third parameter. For array filter lodash has _.find() but I'd rather use the regular filter(). But I still think the above method _.get() is super useful when working with really complex data. I faced in the past really complex APIs and it was handy! I hope it can be useful for who's looking for options to manipulate really complex data which the title implies. I don't think questioner just only concern one level nested object, so I present the following demo to demonstrate how to access the node of deeply nested json object. All right, let's find the node with id '5'.  In 2020, you can use @babel/plugin-proposal-optional-chaining it is very easy to access nested values in an object. https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-optional-chaining https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining In below deep(data,key) function, you can use arbitrary key string - in your case items[1].name (you can use array notation [i] at any level) - if key is invalid then undefined is return.  You can use the syntax jsonObject.key to access the the value. And if you want access a value from an array, then you can use the syntax jsonObjectArray[index].key. Here are the code examples to access various values to give you the idea.  jQuery's grep function lets you filter through an array:  Here is an answer using object-scan. When accessing a single entry, this answer doesn't really provide much benefit over vanilla javascript. However interacting with multiple fields at the same time this answer can be more performant.
